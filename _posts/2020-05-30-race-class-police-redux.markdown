In 2016, I wrote a post about [Race, Class, and the
Police](https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2016/07/07/race-class-police.html),
and in the wake of Amy Cooper, George Floyd, and Regis
Korchinski-Paquet, I think most of it remains relevant. However, I get a
sense of fatalism or determinism in it now, the idea that real social
justice can't be approached until the revolution, which gives the wrong
impression of what must be done now. I would add to the post's practical
prescription of banning guns the immediate programme of defunding the
police, which it seems to me would have the immediate benefit of forcing
the state to at least approach its need for discipline and violent
oppression in some other or new way.

Additionally, since I wrote that post I read Federici's *Caliban and the
Witch* which does an amazing job exposing the *necessity* of anti-Black
racism, misogyny, Indigenous dispossession and all the other mechanisms
of "primitive accumulation", and the ways in which those mechanisms
continue to operate today.
