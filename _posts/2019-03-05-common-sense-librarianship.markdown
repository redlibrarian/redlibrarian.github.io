Negri, <em>Political Descartes</em>

One of the most insidious aspects of the triumph of instrumental reason
under neoliberalization is its quantification, not only of natural
phenomena, but of the self. Methodological individualism - the idea that
there is something called "the individual" which forms the origin and
basis of social forms - not only continues the isolating alienation of
earlier forms of capitalism (required for the mystification and
'rationalization' of capitalist labour processes) but grounds the idea of
the ["data
body"](http://world-information.org/wio/infostructure/100437611761/100438659695)
as the collection of data-traces left within virtual systems as well as
the site of "surveillance capitalism", platform-health-trackers and, in
the academic world, metrics and analytics. Libraries are being drawn
into the datafication of the student body out of a concern for ["student
outcomes"](https://library.educause.edu/resources/2018/11/library-integration-in-institutional-learning-analytics),
but the real world outcome remains the same: quantification,
dismemberment, exploitation.

Many librarians are critical of the push towards quantification. Ron Day
has argued that libraries in the 20th century chose an instrumental
"documentation" model of texts drawn from Otlet over a "hermeneutic"
model drawn from Heidegger, which helped libraries to integrate within
the military-industrial-scientific complex and its model of knowledge production and
circulation, giving us access to the government funding that supported
that complex. On the other hand, some tendencies within librarianship,
such as Evidence-Based LIS, embrace the scientific model of knowledge
and understanding. The narrow focus in library school research methods classes
on positivist social science reinforces the documentalist, scientific
mode of understanding within the profession.

But this dichotomy is not of recent origin and it is not restricted to
librarianship. Hans-Georg Gadamer opens his monumental <em>Truth and
Method</em> with a discussion of the challenges to the "new science"
inaugurated by Descartes. Descartes philosophical justification for the
scientific method quickly became hegemonic
within "rational", quantative, experimental explosion of 17th century
science. The human sciences, hopeful of achieving the kinds of rapid
advance demonstrated by scientists like Newton, looked to the method of
the natural sciences as the way to accomplish this. In the course of the
19th century, the "human sciences" attempted to reconstruct themselves
along the lines of natural science, importing the standards of truth,
logic, and evidence into the humanities and social sciences. But
Cartesian science and its applicability to the human sciences was
challenged from the very beginning. One of the victories of
neoliberalism seems to be the victory of the scientific method over
other forms of understanding within the humanities and social sciences.

For the early critics of the "new science", "the specific problem that
the human sciences present to thought has not rightly grasped their
nature if one measures them by the yardstick of a progressive knowledge
of regularity. The experience of the sociohistorical world cannot be
raised to a science by the inductive procedure of the natural sciences"
(Gadamer, 4). For Gadamer, the distinction between the natural sciences
and the human sciences is that, because the object of the human sciences
is humanity and society, we - as researchers - cannot remove ourselves
from them, cut ourselves off from our objects of study, as is required
by the objectivity of science and the scientific method. We bring our
entire lived experience - as individuals living in societies - to the
study of humanity and social forms. Gadamer writes that

>The human sciences are connected to modes of experience that lie
>outside science: with the experiences of philosophy, of art, and of
>history itself. These are all modes of experience in which a truth is
>communicated that cannot be verified by the methodological means proper
>to science... One must have a sense for the aesthetic and the
>historical or acquire it, if one is to be able to rely on one's tact in
>work in the human sciences... A logically consistent application of
>[the scientific] method as the only norm for the truth of the human
>sciences would amount to their self-annihilation...

The kind of knowledge and understanding required in the study of society
is *a very different kind* of knowledge from that gained in the study of
natural phenomena. When librarianship chose documentation over
hermeneutics, it committed to a particular kind of knowledge that is
inextricable from the instrumental rationality of capitalism in general and, now,
the exploitative and oppressive quantification of neoliberal capitalism.

Why are the scientific form of knowledge and capitalist exploitation
inextricable? In an early work, Antonio Negri argues that Cartesian
dualism - not only the distinction between mind and matter, but between
an individual subject and an external, objective world - arose out of
the failed bid by the bourgeoisie to capture political power in the
Thirty Years War. In Negri's view, the humanist singular conception of
the individual and the world is present in the early work of Descartes,
but in the later work this has been replaced by the strict separation
between mind and body, subject and object, inquirer and external world.
Descartes' philosophy provided a "reasonable ideology" for the
bourgeoisie as it continued it economic and political project over the
next two hundred years. With the political victory of the bourgeoisie in
Europe between 1789 and 1848 (the "Glorious Revolution" of 1688 was an
outlying precursor in the most advanced capitalist country), the long
line of bourgeois conceptions of truth, knowledge, and science from
Descartes through Kant to Hegel achieved an unchallengeable hegemony.
This gives us not only the dominant view of the neutrality of
professions (teachers,
librarians, journalists) somehow able to stand <em>outside</em> their
objects of study and their work, but also the idea that artificial
intelligence can take the place of humanity in the world (because the
"intelligence" of AI is equated with the scientific
model of knowledge; but it cannot take the place of a non-dualist,
humanistic form of knowledge). To take a library example, the problem
with LCSH subject headings is not that definitions and mores shift over
time, but that we think that we can "scientifically" apply descriptors
from a postion outside of human social and political relationships. The [Brian Deer Classification
System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Deer_Classification_System)
and [Dorothy Porter's work at Howard
University](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/remembering-howard-university-librarian-who-decolonized-way-books-were-catalogued-180970890/?utm_source=twitter.com)
are important not only because they provide decolonized alternatives to
LC or DDC, but because they are based not on a separation between
cataloguer and community/society, but on the cataloguer being a part of
community.

The pre-Cartesian, humanistic view of knowledge persisted, and
Gadamer sees hermeneutics as the culmination of this second, minor trend
in philosophy and scholarly method. Negri, too, sees value in
rehabilitating a pre-Cartesian humanism in order to challenge the
dehumanizing instrumental rationality of capitalism. In Gadamer's view,
two of the most important Renaissance concepts needed to challenge the
scientific mode of knowledge, to insist on a <em>different kinds</em> of
truth in the human sciences, are Bildung (culture) and "sensa communis"
(common sense). 

After Descartes and the rise of dualist, instrumental rationality, human
beings became "characterized by the break with the immediate and the
natural that the intellectual, rational side" of our lives demands. This
break is what has allowed human beings to be operated on with the
dispassion and disinterest that we treat the natural world. Horkheimer and Adorno
connected instrumental reason to the crimes of the Holocaust, the
ability to treat human beings as non-human, as raw material, as objects.
But it leads also to quantified tracking, surveillance, the resurgence
of eugenics, and "scientific" racism. We are finally seeing the results
of Cartesian dualism on the natural world, as capitalism propels us
headlong towards climate catastrophe; but we are happy to continue with
a scientific dualism that treats "human resources" as raw materials for
power and profit. Bildung - or culture - is the accumulation of
experience with and through society and the natural world that gives us
a place within it, and the kind of knowledge that would prevent us from
treating human beings and the planet as disposable.

"Common sense" on the other hand, doesn't mean what we think it means.
Common sense is not a particular "sense" that all people share out of
some fundamental human nature. Rather, it comes out of the education and
experience of living within a particular "commune", a particular
society. Gadamer writes that

>The most important thing in education is... the training in the sensus
>communis, which is not nourished on the true but on the probable, the
>verisimilar. The main thing for our purposes is that here sensus
>communis obviously does not mean only that general faculty in all
>[people] but in the sense that founds community.

What the isolation and alienation of capitalism has produced, what
arises out of the "methodological individualism" of liberalism and the
natural-scientific method applied to the human sciences, is the death of
the "sensus communis". All the calls for civility in politics, all the
criticisms of postmodernism as causing (rather than being a symptom of)
the death of truth and the ability to communicate (or even to
<em>have</em>) shared experiences, all of this comes out Descartes
sleight-of-hand that founds the philosophical justification for
capitalism. Individually, with no shared goals or values, we fight
amongst ourselves. Divided, we fall for "fake news", propaganda,
advertising.

Despite the views of early "library scientists" like Dewey and Cutter, the lack of any kind of "sensus communis" in librarianship has been felt
for a long time. It is widespread in the literature of the profession
and its philosophy, from Archibald MacLeish in 1940:

>Nothing is more difficult for the beginning librarian than to discover
>in what profession he is engaged. Certain professions define
>themselves. Others are defined by those who practice them. The
>librarian's profession is of neither sort. A librarian is so called not
>for what he does, as the farmer who farms or the lawyer who laws, but
>from the place in which he does it. And the definitions of the
>librarians, though the are eloquent in describing the librarian's
>perfections, are reticent in saying what the librarian's perfections
>are for. (MacLeish, "Of the Librarians' Profession")

To Buschman in 2018:

>Librarians and administrators often fall back on an improvised
>admixture of utilitarian and capabilities approaches in response to
>their ideals operating in fluid and challenging circumstances. Are we
>at a dead end then, with libraries vaguely described as a good, which
>is most often interpreted by boards and administrators as merely
>feel-good? (Buschman, "Everyday Life, Everyday Democracy in Libraries:
>Toward Articulating the Relationship")

This lack of a common sense, a set of shared values, priorities, and
goals, lies at the heart not only of our jumping on board any new
initiative that comes up, but of our focus on the technical and
technological side of our work at the expense of the humanistic. But it
is also at the root of Fobazi Ettarh's "vocational awe" - a religiosity
that tries to compensate for a lack of real humanist commitment, and our
problems around
[racism](https://aprilhathcock.wordpress.com/2019/01/30/alamw-what-happened-and-what-should-happen-next/) and [lack of diversity](http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2016/quest-for-diversity/). The way we treat
librarians of colour - and I am thinking here specifically of precarious
workers and diversity interns, in Canada this often singles out Indigenous
women - is impossible to remedy as long as we don't choose for ourselves
and our profession some kind of common goal or set of values and then
stick with them. The vague "strategic priories" of our organizations do
no good; diversity theatre is dangerous; the instrumental rationality
that drives our decision-making goes unchallenged. We decry the abuse of
analytics and other kind of data, but we go along with the idea that the
scientific method is an appropriate methodology for a social profession
like librarianship. I've written elsewhere about the need for a
political commitment on the part of libraries - something that might
help prevent policies like [Winnipeg Public Library's](https://globalnews.ca/news/4965496/millennium-library-security-screening/), itself predicated
on a parochial separation between the state and its citizens - but in
addition to this we need a commitment to our own self-definition of
goals and values predicated on our sense of community. 

In order to
achieve such a sense of community, however, we need to destroy all those insidious
processes, like instrumental rationality itself, whose function is to
separate, isolate, and alienate us from each other. This may not be
possible without a revolution, but in the mean time we have to face some
hard social truths, challenge unpleasant realities, and have the kinds
of difficult conversations that instrumental reason, methdological
indvidualism, and quantification are all designed precisely to prevent
us from having. The alienated, ideological "common sense" of neoliberalism is a hard habit to
shake, but I think we need to start there, among our co-workers and
administrators, challenging decisions, getting organized, deciding for
ourselves what kind of profession we want to be. But this decision
cannot be top-down, hierarchical, or based on unchallenged assumptions,
as our decisions tend to be. Rather, it needs to be communal, bottom-up,
democratic in a radical, Renaissance sense.
