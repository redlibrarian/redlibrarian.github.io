Vasily Grossman, *Everything Flows*.

The schedule for this year's Alberta Library Association conference is
up, and I see that Pilar Martinez, CEO of Edmonton Public Library, and
Jim Turk, Director of Ryerson's Centre for Free Expression are on the
road again. Last September, Pilar convened a panel at EPL with Jim Turk, Toni
Samek and Gail DeVos, moderated by Alvin Schrader on Intellectual
Freedom. I wrote about that event in a [blog
post](https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2018/09/11/intellectual-freedom-value-ethics.html),
where I said that the whole experience of was demoralizing.

In January of this year, Jim Turk received the Les Fowlie Intellectual
Freedom award at the Ontario Library Association Superconference. He was also
on the Intellectual Freedom Spotlght panel with - again - Pilar and
Micheal Vonn, entitled "What is Hate Speech, and What Do We Do About
It?"

And so again, in April, Pilar and Jim - along with Dale Askey (full
disclosure: Dale is my boss) and Christina de Castell, are holding a
panel discussion on "Social Responsibility & Neutrality in Libraries" at
the Alberta Library Association Conference.

Now, I don't want to prejudge the ALC panel, but I do want to point out
the extreme homogeneity of voices in all these panels. By my count the
panels have consisted of:

* Two Directors in intellectual freedom organizatons (Ryerson's and the BC
Civil Liberties Association).
* Three urban public library CEO's.
* The chief librarian of a large academic library.
* The chair of a library school.

Gail DeVos and Alvin Schrader are a bit of an outlier here, as they are not (currently) at the top of a
hierarchical organization committed to a single particular
interpretation of intellectual freedom. This interpretation - the
liberal interpretation - is currently being heavily challenged not only
in librarianship (by #critlib among others) but in wider society,
especially around the idea of deplatforming right-wing speakers and
ideologues. No wonder Pilar and Jim feel the time is ripe for a liberal
intellectual freedom roadshow.

As people are pointing out right now, we've stopped hearing from Milo
Yiannopoulous since he was successfully deplatformed. Media outlets are
refusing to share the Christchurch murderer's "manifesto", and many
people are pointing out how much that screed [owes to the proliferation
of far-right, anti-semitic, Islamophobic, white-supremacist information
in the last few
years (content warning)](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/rest-of-world/2019/03/15/shitposting-inspirational-terrorism-and-the-christchurch-mosque-massacre/). Deplatforming works, and surely the
suppression of the most vile right-wing, white-supremacist material will
go unlamented except by those who want to murder with impunity.

Toni Samek noted at the EPL panel that such debates pitting social
responsibility against intellectual freedom recur approximately every
thirty years. But such recurrence should not make us complacent about
it. Capitalist crises recur at approximately the same rate, but only
the most hardened apologist for human misery would suggest that this
should be a reason not to worry too much about crisis.

The homogeneity of the panelists leads them to put something like this
in their ALC panel description: "But with everything going on in the
world around us, can we be truly neutral?" This question is painfully
outdated. A quick survey of articles, blog posts, panels, and keynotes in
librarianship over the last few years shows that the starting point for
a discussion of social responsibility *has* to begin with a complete
disavowal of the notion of neutrality. The demoralization I felt at the
EPL event was primarily around the safe comfortable moderateness of the
terms of the debate. If the ALC panel is going to talk (yet again!)
about "whether libraries are neutral" then I am fairly sure the
panel will do a disservice to the profession and to the conference
attendees. There are dozens of alternative voices who could have posed a
real challenge to this idea, voices who are not embedded at the top of
systems of power - could none of them be found to participate? Or is
that somehow outside the purview (or comfort zone) of the Jim and Pilar
Roadshow?

Or is it that the point is not to debate the question of intellectual
freedom or neutrality at all, but to present a common front, to
reinforce the standard professional discourse of liberal hegemony? The
homogeneity of the panels suggests that radically different points of
view are not of major concern or interest.

At the OLA Superconference, I presented a critique of the mythological
connection between libraries and democracy, and I argued that the usual
liberal bromides and platitudes are based on a presumption that people
aren't dying and that we have all the time in the world for reasoned
debate and arriving at consensus. Climate change is putting hard limit
on the time we have left, and - sadly - the fact that real human lives
are being wantonly destroyed is brought home again and again and again.
Yesterday's white-supremacist attack against Muslims in New Zealand
demonstrates yet again that liberal platitudes like intellectual
freedom, free speech absolutism, pluralism, and tolerance are not fit
for the current social and political conjuncture.

The time for platitudes is over, the time for asking whether libraries
are "neutral" is long over. The time for new voices in the intellectual
freedom field has come. I realize that the convenors of these panels -
whether Pilar Martinez or someone else - have no requirement to include
alternative, diverse, challenging voices, but the panelists and
convenors must be prepared for criticism from those of us who see an
absolute liberal intellectual freedom as intimately linked with the
murders that took place in Christchurch yesterday.

Intellectual freedom is an [abstract impossibility, designed to keep
people (classes, races, genders) in their
place](https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2018/07/12/marxism-and-intellectual-freedom.html). The politics of the
current conjuncture are shifting beyond liberal hegemony and the time
has come to demolish the criminal laissez-faire complacency of
intellectual freedom and, as I have [written
elsewhere](https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2018/09/11/intellectual-freedom-value-ethics.html) to replace a discredited "intellectual freedom" with a committed intellectual politics. That is, if we actually want to prevent more racist crimes, more white-supremacist murders, from taking place.
