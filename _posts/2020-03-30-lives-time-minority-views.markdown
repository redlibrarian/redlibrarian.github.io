Two of the main tenets of liberal intellectual freedom are that
IF-protections are in place so that minority views are able to be
expressed, and that the only way to challenge incorrect views is to
subject them to debate and argument in order for the truth to emerge.
These two views are clearly interrelated: in order for an incorrect view
to be challenged and refuted, it has to be publicly expressible.. In
Mill's *On Liberty* (1859), which provides the blueprint for all this, he argues
that the reason we need to protect the ability of minority views is
because we can never be 100% sure of the truth - for Mill, this isn't a
question of protecting whatever theory someone has come up with, but
that their perspective may end up being true, and repressing the truth
is by definition wrong. Mill's *System of Logic* (1843) was extremely influential on much of
the scientific thinking that ended up dominating the social sciences in the 20th century, and Mill is here thinking purely of
empirical, scientific truth. However, There is another kind of truth which we might call political truth -
which I think Gadamer gets at in his *Truth and Method* - which is very
different from empirical truth. The truth status of, say, Nazism is
beside the point, indeed it is for many people beyond the pale even to
look into its truth status; we reject Nazism not because it is *false*
but because it is *heinous*.

In *Confronting the Democratic Discourse of Librarianship* I argued that
liberalism leads to two assumptions which, especially in times of
crisis, are not tenable: the first is that because the right kind of
people may not be dying, no-one is dying (this is the issue of *lives*)
and the second is that there is no limit on the time we should take
(deliberation, argument) to arrive at the truth. Especially in times of
crisis, however, the adherence to this view ends up costing more lives
and wasting more time. While this was a question of the lives of trans
people and the time limit imposed by climate change, liberal defenders
of IF-absolutism did not need to think very much about this problem. The
COVID-19 pandemic has changed all that. Now, in a very real sense, the
people who are dying are not only the people bourgeois society thinks it
is OK to sacrifice; the virus draws no such distinctions. And as we know
from experts in epidemiology and emergency response, the *speed* with
which a society reacts to an epidemic is critical; time, quite
literally, is of the essence.

Enter Richard Epstein, a legal scholar who objected to an
epidemiological model used in a New York Times Study because he had a
*sense* it was wrong. This sense, it will surprise no-one to learn, is
in fact Epstein's libertarian ideology. The New Yorker [challenged
Epstein](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-contrarian-coronavirus-theory-that-informed-the-trump-administration)
on his views, because his own epidemiological model (remember, he is a
legal scholar and law professor) conformed with the ideological
preferences of the White House and has gained some currency there. The
New Yorker had two actual epidemiologists fact-check Epstein's claim -
doctors whose time could have been better spent doing almost anything
else.

What is important for the discussion of intellectual freedom is that in
the New Yorker interview, Epstein clearly makes the "lives and time"
case, both in terms of "minority views" and in terms of "time to argue":

>Q: Are the stakes too high to publish articles with basic errors?
>A: This is not a mistake. It’s an open challenge. I’ve spent my entire life as a lawyer taking on established wisdom. My view about it is what you’re asking me to do is, when I think everybody is wrong, to remain silent, and the stakes are too high.

>after you start declaring emergencies you have time for reflection and adaptation and modification, which you don’t have in a fire case. So the political point is one which essentially says, when you see governors of three major states putting out statements that their experts have said this, that, and the other thing is a result, and you don’t see the studies and you can’t question the assumption, I regard that as a serious breakdown in the political process.

Now, Epstein doesn't necessarily believe that the *wrong* people are
going to be dying while his minority views get aired, but he does think
that - according to his minority view - fewer people are going to die in
any event, and those people dying is no reason not to go through the
rules of "political process" by which claims are deliberated in due
time, rebuttals formulated, and challenges addressed. Epstein holds to
Mill's view that what we are all looking for here is the *truth*.
However, the truth is *not* at issue, *saving lives* is at issue. Dr
Michael J. Ryan, Executive Director of the World Health Organization,
said much the same thing in a [video
clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqRHH6e-y6I) that recently went viral: "Speed trumps
perfection... If you need to be right before you move, you will never
win."

This appears to put the abstract and deliberative foundations of liberal
intellectual freedom in jeopardy. James Turk asks, "Why would any
marginalized minority trust representatives of the majority to determine
whose expression is to be allowed and whose is to be censored?" In this
case, I would argue that marginalized minorities like disabled people
and immunocompromised people would need - perhaps "trust" is too strong
a word - would need to expect the majority (epidemiologists and
emergency response doctors) to determine that spurious theories which
are going to get more people killed should be suppressed. Reading
through Epstein's article, and this is a point the New Yorker journalist
makes, it is clear even to those of us who know very little about
medicine that Epstein is talking complete nonsense, hiding behind a
defense of minority views and the "political process" of argument and
debate. Intellectual freedom *cannot* be absolute, unless we are
prepared to accept an unconscionable death rate. What this points out,
of course, is that there is *no* position which does not *determine*
suppression, which liberal IF consistently maintains: there is suppression
of opinion and there is real harm up to and including death. 

The liberal idealism of Epstein and Turk cannot make the connection
between opinion and real harm. In many ways this is because liberal
philosophy inherited the mind-body dualism of the "bourgeois ideologue"
Descartes. This mind-body dualism, in which neither can affect the
other, lies perhaps right at the heart of the lives and time problem: if
questions of the mind, of intellectual freedom and free speech, can
*never* have a material effect on the world, if climate change does not
worsen and people do not die due to the expression of some "minority
views", then there is nothing to worry about. One only hopes that
IF-absolutists see the error of their ways before many more people have
to die. 

Now, there are very real political concerns around the coronavirus
response. On the right, these have to do with government spending and
the social Darwinism that argues that the weakest deserve to die. On the
left, these concerns have to do with social isolation and
state-authoritarianism simply furthering the alienation and
totalitarianism of capitalism. I agree completely with the left-wing
concerns expressed here. However, and here is where [recent criticism of
Giorgio Agamben's "COVID
trutherism"](http://moufawad-paul.blogspot.com/2020/03/thoughts-on-pandemic-and-biopolitics.html)
comes into play, the issue is saving lives. Process and procedure that
may be justifiable in "normal" times are unconscionable in times of
crisis. Will social-distancing and isolation exacerbate the problem of
alienation and impede the left's ability to organize? Almost certainly.
Will this set left-organization back? Again, almost certainly. But we
cannot sacrifice potentially thousands or millions of people on that
basis. In Canada, the government recently implemented an employee
support fund in response to the crisis, but the bureaucratic
channels are slow and inefficient (process!). Critics of this method
have argued that rather than going through proper channels and following
the usual procedure, the government should simply mail cheques to every
Canadian, and at income tax time next year, tax the money back from
anyone who didn't need it. An analogy, of this, I think, is the correct
political response to the crisis: let the government and experts do what
they need to do to save lives now; the left will "tax it back" in the
future when the current crisis has passed.

Of course, we will continue to have to use our political judgement to
determine how much is too much. This, for example, out of Hungary, looks
less like coronavirus response than the implementation of dictatorship:
