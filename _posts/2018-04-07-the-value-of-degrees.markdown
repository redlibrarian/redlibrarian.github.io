Two interesting tweets showed up in my timeline today, one by April
Hathcock and a reponse by @hayzeus89. The gist of the tweets was that,
given the increasing recognition of a PhD in place of an MLIS, then we
should also accept years of service in non-MLIS positions, in effect
being able to convert non-MLIS years of service into the equivalent of
an MLIS. On the face of it, this is similar to the proposals for
automatic conversion from contract faculty to tenure track positions
after a certain number of years of service.

What this ignores, though, is the economic (that is, the exchange) value
of the degree itself. Foucault's view of education under neoliberalism
is that education is an entrepreneurial investment. Like any commodity,
one's labour power increases in (exchange) value with the value of the
commodities that go into it. We can split the component commodities -
following Marx - into constant capital (means of production and raw
materials) and variable capital (labour power). In this view, the
variable capital expended on one's education is both one's own and the labour
of the professors, TAs, library staff, support staff, etc, etc, that
make up one's career as a student. This labour is measured in labour-time,
so the more years of work tied up in one's degree, by *all workers
involved*, not just oneself, add to the value of one's degree. On the other
hand, the value of the buildings, the value of one's professors' degrees,
etc, also feed into the value of one's degree. The value put into building
the building, or the value of one's professors' degrees are transferred,
to a certain extent to the value of one's own degree. It stands to reason,
then, that a *longer* time spent "investing" in one's labour power will
command a higher price on the labour market.

On the other hand, time spent as non-MLIS staff
is not, according to neoliberal logic, investment in one's labour power.
It is labour, the transferring of value into a commodity. The value
transferred by a non-MLIS worker to the commodity we produced is *less*
than that of an MLIS holder or a PhD. It makes sense, then, according to
neoliberal logic, that PhD holders are more desirable in MLIS positions
(because a PhD takes more labour time to produce/acquire) than a
non-MLIS holding staff member. The price of our commodity goes up if we
put a PhD holder in an MLIS position, and goes down if we put a
non-MLIS holder in the same position. In terms of the value of the
commodity (degrees, labour power), a PhD has higher value than an MLIS
and an MLIS has a higher value than, say, a library technician
certificate. If we want to transfer more value to the commodity (ie.
cause the price to go up), then we want to underpay PhDs, rather than
overpay library technicians.

In this view, of course education is not about educating citizens,
education is not *even* the commodity universities are selling. What is
being sold is the "graduated worker" or the "worker-with-degrees.
Library labour can then be understood as itself a value-input into the
exchange-value of this commodity.

What I find interesting in all these discussions in the library world is
that we substitute "is" language for "ought" language. The theme of this
year's ALC conference is a good example: "We stand up: we inspire hope,
create change, and empower individuals and groups. We listen, we learn.
We stand for human rights, for dignity, and for access to information."
This is *is* language, it says that we *are* doing these things.
Any consultation with the critical or progressive or social justice wing
of librarianship will disprove that idea. That we *ought* to be doing
these things is a much more supportable argument, but for whatever
reason in librarianship (and perhaps more widely) we succumb to this
elision of *is* and *ought*.

I think it's important for a critical theory of librarianship to insist
on the strict separation of is and ought, just as we have to maintain a
strict vigilance about why we *say* we do certain things (e.g. "hiring
PhDs to MLIS positions is an act of inclusion"). This is all part of the
de-mystification process that I think lies at the heart of all critical
analysis. I don't like the neoliberal logic expressed in the analysis
above, and I think the social and economic conditions that give rise to
it *ought* to be abolished, by force if necessary, but I think it's
important to be able to recognize the logics that *are* at work in
contemporary social phenomena.
