I've written about library values on this blog many times before.
Basically, I've questioned whether our espoused values are anything but
rhetorical public-relations tools, whether they enjoin actual behaviours
on the part of library workers (this holds true for "professional
ethics" in an unregulated profession as well), and how they connect up
with a social "value" of libraries. There's also the question of a
*hierarchy* of values. Professional leaders tend to deny the presence of
such a hierarchy, but I and other critics of absolutist intellectual
freedom have pointed out that when push comes to shove intellectual
freedom tends to trump (can we ever use this word again?) other espoused
values like community engagement and partnership. The Vancouver Public
Library TERF-platforming is a case in point, as the values of
community-led planning and community partnerships were jettisoned in
defense of an absolutist adherence to IF. VPL's relationship with a
number of its communities suffered as a consequence.

I have also written about the *proceduralism* of liberal ethical and
political thought. Liberalism has always been the ideology of bourgeois
capitalism, and modern liberalism takes its cues from industrialization,
assembly-line work, Fordism/Taylorism, etc. As a result, there is a
focus on following procedures as the best way to achieve a desired
outcome. Ronald Dworkin made this explicit when he enunciated two
competing theories of equality. One such theory argues that, because
individuals can and do differ on their conceptions of "the good", the
role of the liberal state and its civil society institutions (like
libraries) is to ensure the proper function of procedures (the law,
regulations, etc) to ensure every individual's ability to pursue their
own idea of the good life. This is the equality of rights enshrined in
John Rawls' first principle of justice.

On the other hand, a community, society, or state could explicitly
commit itself to a conception of the good life and implement policies
that aim to further our achievement of that good life. We can see this
in the case of Quebec, where the *survivance* of Quebecois francophonie
is identified as a substantive good warranting the infringement of
individual rights. One thing that such a position requires is that we
(community, society, or state) be able to articulate our vision of these
substantive goods. This view is that of Rawls' second principle of
justice.

I think one way library values are ambiguous is that they can be read as
articulations of substantive goods - and I suspect many library workers
and members of the public *do* read them this way - but they can also be
read procedurally, and this is the way they are often understood by library
leadership, LIS professors, professional organizations, etc.

Take, for example, intellectual freedom. This could be read as a
substantive good: something like Kant's definition of Enlightenment as
the freeing of the individual mind from self-incurred ignorance. This
would then be a goal we would implement policies to further, but it
would require us to articulate what exactly "freedom" consists in, what intellectual activity counts as free, etc. This perspective would see intellectual freedom as an *outcome* libraries are bound to work towards. (Full disclosure: given the existence of culture and education, I don't think there is any such thing *as* intellectual freedom).

 But we know
from the defenses of absolutist IF that it is more often conceived
procedurally: the library's policies are meant to be neutral, to have no
opinion as to what freedom is or what intellectual activity might or
might not be free. Rather, IF is something that belongs *originally* to
every individual, as a *right*, and the library's role is to ensure that
no policies get in the way or infringe this right. In this sense, IF is
seen not as an outcome but as an origin. Individuals decide for
themselves what intellectual freedom is, and that decision is in itself
intellectually free. The right and ability to make that decision must be
protected by library procedures.

(NOTE: I don't think these two positions are as well-defined in practice
as I have laid them out here. The profession's thinking about values and
goods is not particularly clear or coherent). 

However, there *is* a good associated with Intellectual Freedom, the good of
the well-informed citizen and their participation in democracy. But this
again is described procedurally: the well-informed citizen participates
in democracy solely through the electoral process. Intellectual freedom
guarantees the ability to participate in this process, but takes no
position on the outcome. The election of Donald Trump, Boris Johnson,
Jair Bolsonaro are the inevitable result of procedural views of
justice faced with grifters who *do* have their own substantive views of
the good (self-aggrandizement, ego-boosting, power).

What happens in libraries is that the procedure takes the place of any
substantive vision of a good outcome. Library leaders can think that
there is no hierarchy of values because *procedurally* they are able to
rent library space to TERF speakers *and* perform community consulations
and do the project work necessary for community partnerships. A classic
example of this was the scandalous TPL board meeting of October 2019
which fulfilled the *procedural* requirements of hearing from the
community, etc, but made no difference to the decision actually made.
The procedures of IF and community engagement, in this view, are not in
conflict.

But what I want to argue here is that procedural liberalism (or liberal
proceduralism) is *not* agnostic when it comes to a conception of the
good. There *is* a good - or rather, a set of goods - that underpins proceduralism. But these "goods" are unmarked, do not have to be articulated, because they are already the default "goods" of racial, heteropatriarchal capitalism: these are the "goods" of private property, exploitation, racism, sexism, transmisia, ableism, etc. Liberal proceduralism simply allows these unacknowledged, unarticulated "goods" to take precedence over any other under the guise of procedural neutrality.

Two recent Canadian political examples demonstrate this in spades.
First, the unwillingness for Canadian provincial governments to shut
down the economy to respond to the pandemic (and I know this is far from
a problem specific to Canada). This, they argue,
violates the equal right of every individual to choose for themselves,
the right to a livelihood, the right to follow individual desires, etc, etc. The state is there to ensure the equal application of universal rights, not to actually *do* anything to ensure the achievement of a good, even if that good is the lives of millions of people.  But the unacknowledged good is for
profit over the lives of workers, the disabled, the elderly, anyone
"unproductive". It is also the good of "fiscal responsibility", the
unwillingness to spend money to achieve any kind of social good as a
result. Fiscal responsibility is a binding, unquestionable procedure. (We can see here how in practice proceduralism and the
inarticulate good of bourgeois capitalism are fundamentally intertwined).

The other recent example is over the RCMP intervention (or lack of
intervention) in various protests. The procedural neutrality of the RCMP
when settler fishers were attacking Indigenous fishing activity in Nova
Scotia was undermined by their violent intervention in Indigenous
protests over the course of 2020. RCMP proceduralism applies to white
settlers - the universal application of equal rights is colourblind! -
but is cast aside when an unacknowledged settler-colonial good (racist
state violence against Indigenous people) can be indulged in.

Tl;dr the procedural view of equality expressed by Dworkin and derived
from Rawls is a lie. It simply mystifies and obscures an unarticulated
good that is hegemonic, unmarked, and commonsense in racial capitalism.
And it provides a means for these unarticulated "goods" - prejudice
against trans people, for example - to be pursued under the guise of
neutrality and a disavowal of outcomes. The procedural adherence to
library values is, in fact, an abdication of those values.

What we as a profession need is an open, frank, articulation of
substantive goods of the profession. This would not be an easy
discussion, as the procedural, liberal view is so deeply entrenched. nd
because our professional goods are defended by conflict aversion, white
tears, white rage, vocational awe, etc. But
I think this question of the substantive good is what has underpinned
much of 
critical, radical, or progressive librarianship from the origins of
Social Responsibility at the end of the 1960s. Often it seems as if we
are no further along since then; but equally, there seems little alternative but
to keep fighting for concrete, substantive visions of a just society.

One major problem with the divide between critical librarianship, "angry"
librarians, social justice discourse, etc, and the dominant, hegemonic
structures of library leadership is that library leaders (in libraries,
professional associations, and library schools) are never called upon to
defend their views or articulate their notions of the good. Critical
librarians do, because our goods are never unmarked, never commensense,
always have to be articulated, justified, and defended. This too
contributes to the exhaustion of critique.
