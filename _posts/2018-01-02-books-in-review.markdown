Last January, I resolved to finish as many books as possible. I'm a
chronic book-abandoner, and I thought that perhaps putting a review up
of each book I finished would be an incentive to finish more things. As
a result, I read (to completion) 27 books (11 novels and 16
non-fiction). I'd say I still abandoned about as many books as I
finished - some of them after only a few pages, but a few (which are
still weighing on me) within 50 pages of the end. The last 5% takes 95%
of the effort, or something like that. Following on [Stungeye's annual
"reading and listening
lists"](http://stungeye.com/archive/by_date/2017/03/25), I thought I
would collect the reviews I wrote over the last year here in one place.

One book is missing from this list: William Clare Roberts' *Marx's
Inferno*, which I've reviewed for International Socialism, but the
review hasn't appeared yet. It should be published sometime in January,
so when it's available, I'll update this post.

I'm not sure whether I will stick with trying to review *every* book I
finish this year. I'll still keep track of completions, but sometimes
there wasn't really much to say about a given book.

I still hope to finish some of the lingering things from last year -
Dostoyevsky's *House of the Dead* and Margaret Laurence's *Stone Angel*
are within a stone's throw of completion. I'll probably review those two
as, despite not finishing them (yet), I think there's stuff to comment
on in both books.

EDIT (January 21, 2018): My review of Roberts' *Marx's Inferno* has
appeared in [International
Socialism](http://isj.org.uk/did-marx-base-capital-on-dantes-inferno/)
