>History is what hurts.
\- Fredric Jameson

I somehow missed [Richard Beaudry's post](https://cfe.ryerson.ca/blog/2019/12/intellectual-freedom-debate-why-megan-murphy-and-why-now) post on the Ryerson CFE site last December. In the post, Beaudry asks "What is it about Meghan Murphy that is polarizing some librarians and academic librarians as well as some library associations in Canada and why is this happening now?" Assuming the question is posed in good faith, the answer has to do - as so many answers do - with the problem of history. (Full disclosure: Richard Beaudry was [and I assume still is] the chair of the CFLA Intellectual Freedom committee, from which I stepped down last autumn as the TPL event blew up).

To begin with, Beaudry's contention that "discourse... is becoming
politicized and polarized around rigid presumptions of someone’s opinion being right and the opposing viewpoint being wrong" is itself ahistorical. Many centrists enjoy the language of "becoming" because it positions contemporary events as radically new and absolves them of responsibility for an understanding of history. "Polarization" is in fact the norm in class societies: the hegemonic ideology of bourgeois capitalism is incommensurable with positions of emancipation and social justice. Less abstractly, it is important to remember, as Toni Samek reminds us, that we have been here before. Professional debates around intellectual freedom, social responsibility, and justice recur periodically in librarianship. Often, as in the heated Berninghausen debate of the early 1970s, rhetorical positions get quite heated. To say that they are somehow only now *becoming* polarized shows an ignorance of the history of the profession, as well as the wider political history of late capitalism. The debate between an absolutist IF position and social justice is not simply a disagreement or a difference of opinion, it is a *contradiction* that arises out of the nature of bourgeois society. Following Lukacs, I would argue that such contradictions are not amenable to argument and knowledge, but only to fundamental social change (which, of course, can and must be influenced by argument and knowledge).

Ignorance of history is also evident in Beaudry's uncritical repetition
of TPL's view that the Feminist Unite rental did not contravene
TPL's rental policy. Following the Kulaszka memorial, for which TPL also
came under fire, TPL changed its rental policies *precisely* to make the
bar lower than illegality to deny a room rental. Many, many critics of
TPL's rental to Feminist Unite pointed this out, and to my knowledge
no-one at TPL ever addressed the fact that the changed TPL policy
allowed the library to deny a rental to Feminist Unite. 

>Here is where I must ask myself ‘Why Meghan Murphy and Why Now?’

Beaudry makes no mention of the Kulaszka memorial, nor does he mention
protests over the same speaker renting a room at Vancouver Public
Library earlier in the year (except once in passing), the subsequent
banning of VPL from Vancouver Pride, and the *community* reaction
against room rentals to transphobic speakers. Nor does Beaudry mention the attempt in 2018 by the ALA
Office of Intellectual Freedom to explicitly name "hate groups" among
those to whom libraries are legally obliged to rent space. This change
was approved and then rolled back amid professional pushback and the
work of ALA councillors. It is *this* historical throughline that makes
renting space to this particular speaker such an important touchstone of
professional debates right now. The fact that the same speaker continues
to gain publicity and leverage the trust placed in public libraries (at
VPL again, and at Seattle Public) indicates that this history is far
from over. It is vital to understand the historical aspect of these
debates, if only so as not to wonder idly "why Meghan Murphy and Why
Now?"

With respect to the two other events Beaudry describes in order to
wonder why librarians are not crying foul, I hope to dispense with these
in short order. Regarding Holodomor denial in Edmonton : as a Canadian
of Ukrainian descent who grew up in Winnipeg, a city which boasts a long
history of radical-left Ukrainian internationalism and the most virulent
Ukrainian nationalism, I learned early that it is foolish if not
outright dangerous to take a position on Ukrainian history. "History is
past politics, politics is present history" and there are few places
this is more true than in Ukraine. The debates around Ukrainian history
and the political reality of Ukrainian-Canadians is much more complex
than the libraries' role in platforming transphobia. I should also add
that the question of academic freedom is currently coming to a head at
University of Alberta (and other universities in Canada). Just because you don't see
academic librarians weighing in in public about it (yet) doesn't mean it
isn't happening. There are many different ways to engage, and we are not
required to be consistent simply to satisfy the whataboutery of the
CFE.

(To be fair, the whataboutery works both ways: where is the CFLA or CFE
statement criticizing Winnipeg's draconian security
policies? Or does intellectual freedom not pertain to the marginalized
populations of downtown Winnipeg?)

In terms of the BC school situation, I would again point to history, as
well as geography. The room-rental issue is a national one - indeed, it
is international now that SPL has gotten involved - and as I have
pointed out it has a long history. There is a threshold to be reached
before something impinges on the national or international professional
consciousness. That many librarians in Canada or the US are unaware of
things that are happening in BC schools should not really be surprising.
Again, we can't weigh in on everything.

As Jameson has pointed out, an awareness of history is one of the main
casualities of neoliberal cultural logic. Public libraries and their
defenders have refused to respond to specific criticisms: that refusing
a rental is not censorship, that they are not legally obliged to rent
space to anyone, that they are placing intellectual freedom above all
their other professed values, that they are causing harm (not just
offense) to marginalized communities. It is hard not to see this willful
ignorance of recent history as just another deflection of the criticisms
being made.

The documents released under FOIA have indicated the extent to which TPL
was unwilling to abide by its own policy or to listen to critics of its
position. The board meeting at which the TPL board made trans people relive
trauma in public was not just a farce, it was completely inhumane. The
reliance on authority (such as that of the CFE) to shore up an untenable intellectual freedom
absolutism is, to my mind, an indication of the bankruptcy of that
position. If it is true that Edmonton Public Library "instructed"
(chilling word) a board member to resign, it simply underlines the fact
that what is at issue here - as in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Halifax - is not
intellectual freedom, but the authority of constituted power in the form
of libraries as state institutions, public librarians, and academic
think-tanks.
