John Pateman, CEO of Thunder Bay Public Library, in his article/blog-post in [*Open Shelf*](link) is not wrong to see the origins of the public library lie in structures of
social control. But he takes this to be some kind of atomic fact,
eternal and independent, bearing no relation to any other facts.
Alistair Black, in his *New History of the English Public Library*
(1996) and his work connecting public libraries to the concept of “social
hygiene” ("The Library as Clinic", 2005) has created a convincing argument against the idea of public libraries as agents of enlightenment or progress.

However, the idea that public libraries have “not changed fundamentally” in the last century and a half, while seeming to lead to a
“historical analysis” of public libraries in the Western world, in fact
ignores the reality of history itself. In the first place, it is
patently absurd that any phenomena does not change over time, but in the
second place, and more importantly, Pateman’s view of the public library
sees it as somehow independent of other important changes in Western
society, culture, and politics since the middle of the nineteenth
century. When Pateman states that the public library is an institution
of social control, he carefully avoids identifying the party which
controls and the party which is controlled.

The public library became institutionally enshrined first in England,
in the [Public Libraries Act of 1850](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Libraries_Act_1850). The year is not accidental.
The English capitalist class (bourgeoisie) was the most advanced in
Europe, having demolished Feudalism 150 years before the French
Revolution, in the English Civil War of the 1640s (now known as the War
of the Three Kingdoms). In raising arms against the king, Cromwell and
Parliament inaugurated the primacy of capital in Britain. By 1848, when
the bourgeoisie consolidated power through revolution in the rest of
Europe, the British capitalist class was in complete control of the
country’s society, culture, and politics, a fact confirmed by the [Reform
Act of 1832](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Act_1832). The period 1848-1851 saw the consolidation of power
by capital across Europe (cf. Eric Hobsbawm, *The Age of Capital*), and it is in
this context that public libraries were endowed with political
legitimacy.

The Mechanics’ Institutes *did* provide a model for public libraries,
but their social function was completely different. The bourgeoisie –
which included intellectuals and specialists at the upper-end of the
working class – used Mechanics’ Institutes not only for self-education,
but for the creation and maintenance of a world-view and ideology that
corresponded to their class. (The term “mechanic” meant more what we
would call an engineer, rather than a mechanic in today’s sense). In
principle, the Mechanics’ Institutes occupied a similar position to
coffee houses in Central Europe – they were a forum for the
representation to itself of a class readying to take political and
hegemonic control. They represented, in fact, the self-consciousness of
the bourgeoisie to itself. (Cf. Jurgen Habermas *Structural Transformation of
the Public Sphere*).

With the victory of the revolutions of 1848-1851, however, the project
of the bourgeoisie changed. It no longer had to represent bourgeois
culture and values to itself, it had to ensure their spread to the other
strata of society, the petty-bourgeoisie, the working class and, if
possible, the peasantry. The raising of the public library from the
position of a Mechanics’ Institute to an official state institution
solidified the role of the library in instilling and maintaining the
values of bourgeois society.

This was, however, a period when there were no other sectors of
society through which bourgeois values could be spread. There was no
“entertainment industry”, and the characteristic elements of the culture
industry as a whole (bourgeois practices of concert going and reading,
for example) were only just developing. I would argue that the
development of the state and the culture industry have indeed changed
the fundamental mission of the public library over the subsequent
hundred-and-fifty years.

The capitalist state has passed through various forms since the 1850s.
Initially, in the period of classical liberalism, state infrastructure
was small, as the doctrine of laissez-faire allowed capitalise
enterprise to manage its own affairs. The end of the 19th century,
however, saw the development of finance-capital to accompany, if not to
supplant, large-scale industry. Hilferding, Bukharin, and Lenin himself
in *Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism* (1916/17),
all trace the development of finance capital and the imperialist
consequences of that endeavour. Imperialism, of course, led to larger
state machinery, increased militarisation and, eventually the First
World War. (Indeed, many historians see the First and Second World Wars
as part of a single process of dealing with the fallout of the
imperialist period [cf. Eric Hobsbawm, *The Age of Extremes*]). Following the Second
World War, the state remained larger than in the liberal period, but the
state machinery was refocused away from militarism towards social
programs: the welfare state. The public library in this period became an
institution of social progress, alongside institutions of public health
(like the NHS), public education, etc. Now, this is not to suggest that
public institutions in this period were no longer responsible for
maintaining bourgeois hegemony, but they had changed dialectically: they
were also responsible for increasing the standard of living among the
working classes and the poor, all of whom had been increasingly
radicalised by the horrors of capitalism in the years 1914-1945.

It should come as no surprise that other public institutions of this
period include public broadcasting (e.g. the BBC (founded 1922)) and the
CBC (1936)), and the rapid development of the two most active
sectors of the culture industry, the recording industry and Hollywood.
The public library became only one of a number of public institutions of
the welfare state, but it also increasingly found itself only one of a
number of institutions of the culture industry.

After 1991 – the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War
– the form of the state and the bourgeois-capitalist project changed
again. Seemingly victorious, bourgeois state required systems of
propaganda to counter a rising tide of discontent and protest
(beginning, by most accounts, to the “Battle for Seattle” in 1999). The
public library has become an instrument in that propaganda battle. But
in every historical progression, traces of the previous moment are
always present: the imperialist state is present in the welfare state,
etc. So the progressive mission of the public library that dates from
the welfare state period occupies an uneasy position alongside the
public library as institution of bourgeois propaganda. It is, in fact,
this contradiction within the heart of the public library, as well as
its relations to other social, cultural, and political, phenomena, that
continues to drive its development through time. This movement through
the resolution of contradictions is precisely the way in which history
and the world change over time. One of the core positions of capitalist
ideology is precisely to ignore this process of change, which is why the
Marxist dialectic provides such a challenge to the bourgeois worldview. 

The term “neoliberal” is overused today, and it often goes
unaccompanied by a definition. From one perspective, neoliberalism is a
form of capitalist state formation, driven by a return to small government 
and laissez-faire economics. This
neoliberal position seeks to discredit public institutions, especially
those which achieved a measure of public trust during the welfare state
period, prior to dismantling them completely, in order to regain the
small government of the mid-19th century. This is the neoliberal context
for both the attacks on public health services and attacks on Public
Libraries in Britain and North America (since Thatcher and Reagan, both
regions have been on the frontline of neoliberal depradations). As a
public service, the neoliberals needs to destroy the library, but as an
organization with a measure of public trust, they cannot be upfront
about it. They are not, however, concerned about dismantling the public
library as an institution of propaganda, because laissez-faire
capitalism simply outsources or privatized the function of propaganda to
the other sectors of the culture industry.  It seems to me that Pateman,
by focusing on one particular element of the history of public libraries
and ignoring the rest, is in fact contributing to the circumspect
destruction of public libraries from within, rather than attempting a
good-faith reconstruction of a public library mission.

In Pateman's subsequent post, ["Snuffy's
Revenge"](http://www.open-shelf.ca/160415-snuffys-revenge/), he
discusses an abstraction (like "The Traditional Public Library") he
calls "The Community Led Library". Again, Pateman critique of public
libraries may be in good faith, though they are again based primarily on
vague stereotypes and strawman. However, even if Pateman is in good
faith, the promotion of "community led libraries" can lead - as we have
seen recently in the UK - to reduced government funding and the staffing
of libraries by volunteers, once more supporting the neoliberal agenda of
"small government". Pateman's critiques of "the traditional public
library" and his crude promotion of a "community led" abstraction in the
end simply contributes to the dismantling of public library systems.

EDIT: I've been asked to provide some references for the idea that
"community-led" libraries can be a cover for the defunding/destaffing of
public libraries. Here are few links:

UPDATE: 17/05/2016 - John Pateman has [replied](https://journals.ala.org/ltr/article/view/5675) to a query from [Jane
Schmidt](https://twitter.com/janeschmidt) about the
co-opting of the term "community-led" in the UK. His response implies an
understanding that the term **is** being used in a neoliberal way, but
Pateman dismisses that as an "incorrect use of the term", rather than
seeing how, even with the best intentions, public library discourse
remains dominated by the requirements of the capitalist state.
