It has recently occurred to me that in "bending the stick" away from the
dominant, maximalist view of
[intellectual](https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2019/03/20/intellectual-freedom-positive-or-negative.html) [freedom](https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2019/03/16/christchurch-platforms-intellectual-freedom.html) [in](https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2018/09/11/intellectual-freedom-value-ethics.html)

I may be giving the impression that I don't subscribe to the
library's role in upholding intellectual freedom. I do, but not in a way
that is perhaps recognizable to those who approach intellectual freedom
from the tradition of liberal political and ethical thought. I don't
deny that something which we currently call "intellectual freedom" is
important and something that libraries should uphold, but I think that
"intellectual freedom" is not the right name for it, and that this
mis-naming is not trivial, but is in fact the source of mystification and
the unconscious and obscured reproduction of liberal political theory
and values. The problem is with the word "freedom", a word which carries
an enormous amount of weight in liberal theory and in liberal (i.e.
bourgeois) societies. The problem is that "freedom" in any kind of
unqualified sense does not exist. So whatever this *thing* is that we call
intellectual freedom appears to bourgeois society to be sacrosanct
because it makes a claim to the holy value of "freedom". This renders
any attempt to discuss the concept from a position other than complete
acquiescence automatically suspect, if not always-already the product of
a totalitarian agenda of the left or of the right.

But "freedom" doesn't exist, therefore it should not be held as any kind
of sacred object. Friedrich Engels remarked in the *Anti-Duhring* that
"freedom is the recognition of necessity", that is "freedom" can only be
understood within the context of necessity, can only be understood
through its dialectical opposite, can only ever be *relative* freedom.
The British Marxist Christopher Caudwell, who died fighting in the
Spanish Civil War, used Engels' remark as the epigraph to his first
book, [*Illusion and Reality: A Study of the Sources of
Poetry*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/caudwell/1937/illusion-reality/index.htm) (1937), in which he discusses at length the bourgeois concept of freedom. Freedom for the bourgeoisie is the absence of coercive feudal relationships raised to a mythical, metaphysical primacy. "The bourgeois sees himself as an heroic figure fighting a lone fight for freedom - as the individualist battling against all the social relations which fetter the natural man, who is born free and is for some strange reason everywhere in chains." Here Caudwell refers to Rousseau, but the idea of natural, self-determining *free* individuals coming together more or less unwillingly to form society is the founding myth of all the Social Contract theorists, including Locke and Hobbes. But freedom in this sense is not really freedom, since "freedom without social relations would be no freedom at all" but only anarchy. In a very real sense, as Caudwell writes, "to the bourgeois, freedom is not consciousness of necessity, but the ignorance of it", the ignorance of the necessity of social relations, of social bonds. "To [the bourgeois] the instincts are 'free,' and society everywhere puts them in chains".

Marx criticizes this view in the 1857 *Introduction*, calling them
"Robinsonades" (i.e. tales akin to Robinson Crusoe), and exposing the
ignorance of the primacy of social relationships. He argues that social
relations, like language, pre-exist any and all individuals, and shape
the individual *necessarily*. Freedom can only ever be relative to this
structuration. The methodological individualism of liberal thought
represses this primacy of the social, the conditioning aspects of social
relationships, in favour of a mythical, illusory, non-existent
individualized freedom. The dominant expression of "intellectual
freedom" falls precisely within this perspective, and it is for this
reason that - while I think there is something we currently call
"intellectual freedom" that should be protected - using that term
automatically binds us to the terms and limits of the bourgeois, liberal
worldview.

It is sometimes said that "intellectual freedom" and "social
responsibility" are unfairly polarized. This is probably true (one only
has to look at the division between the ALA's Office of Intellectual
Freedom and the Social Responsibility Round Table to see it). However,
such polarization is based on the [predicate
logic](https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2019/06/20/predicate-and-dialectical-logic.html)
that is dominant in bourgeois society. Predicate logic allows, indeed
requires, a sharp division between the concepts of intellectual freedom
and social responsibility, when no such sharp division really applies. In reality,
"intellectual freedom" (for want of a better expression) is
dialectically (internally) related to social responsibility. The shortcomings of the
intellectual freedom position are contradicted by the positive aspects
of social responsibility and vice versa. It is the instinct of bourgeois
logical categories to keep these two things separate, to rely on the
polarization of the categories to reproduce the isolation and
fragmentation of society. What is needed, however, is a true synthesis
of the two positions. Such a synthesis would recognize the social
*necessity* involved in any conception of intellectual freedom, the
necessity of non-individualistic social relations. It is precisely the
hyper-individualized notion of freedom and the ignorance of the
necessity of social relations that allowed someone like Richard Stallman
to thrive so long in the Free Software Community and MIT. As I've said
before, any conception of "intellectual freedom" that does not recognize
the necessity of social bonds and social responsibility is disingenous,
it does not *in fact* believe in the importance of ideas and words,
their causal power, and their social consequences. Such
disingenuousness, if not hypocrisy, is manifest in the pedantic
hair-splitting exhibited by Stallman and others of that ilk.

Similarly, any attempt to prioritize concrete "production" over
abstract, theoretical "ideation" not only falls prey to what David James
Hudson has called ["the whiteness of
practicality"](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10214/11619/Hudson_Whiteness_Of_Practicality_IR_r1.pdf?sequence=6%3C/li%3E)
but also - as pointed out by Marx, Engels, and many others - simply
serves to obscure and repress very real theoretical, social, and ethical
commitments. "Value-free" production is always based on particular
social standpoints - a lesson drawn from feminist theory, but no less
applicable to a Marxist approach. Returning to Engels, he wrote in
*Dialectics of Nature* that

>natural scientists beleive that they free themselves from philosophy by
>ignoring it or abusing it. They cannot, however, make any headway
>without thought... Hence they are no less in bondage to philosophy, but
>unfortunately in most cases to the worst philosophy...

The unavoidability of philosophy, of theorizing, is not a problem to be solved, but a reality - a necessity - to
be recognized. It is in the nature of our social being for each individual
to be constructed and constrained by the society into which they are
born. Agency, like freedom, is always relative. As Marx memorably put it
in the *18th Brumaire*, "Men make their own history, but they do not
make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected
circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and
transmitted from the past. The tradition of all dead generations weighs
like a nightmare on the brains of the living."

For too long, he traditional, liberal, maximalist intellectual freedom position has held
sway, relying on a sharp distinction between it and Social
Responsibility. If 
nothing else, the current conjuncture - ecological crisis and the
resurgence of fascism - should force adherents of this position to
defend their point of view more strongly, rather than dismissing any
challenge as naive or condemning it as totalitarian.
It needs to rise to the challenge of the current moment. Only in this
way, only by overcoming the division between intellectual freedom and
social responsibility, can a more nuanced, more robust, better-named concept of
"intellectual freedom" survive the challenges of the current moment.
Recognizing that we are not "free", self-created individuals, but that we
are subject to the necessity of our social relationships - and all the
better for it - recognizing that we are all in this world together: only in this way
can any notion of intellectual life *and* social justice be salvaged amid the barbarism to
come.
