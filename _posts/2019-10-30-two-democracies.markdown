Negri, *Insurgencies*

Defenders of intellectual freedom absolutism (we should never allow Vickery
Bowles' rhetorical shift to "free speech" to set the terms of the
debate) like to claim that a) libraries are "cornerstones of democracy" and b) that the state should not be allowed to determine what
can and cannot be said. In his [blog
post](https://cfe.ryerson.ca/blog/2019/10/social-justice-requires-intellectual-freedom-why-toronto-public-library-should-refuse) for the Centre for Free
Expression, Jim Turk put it as follows:

>In a democratic society, the state acts in the name of the majority, not the minority. Why would any marginalized minority trust representatives of the majority to determine whose expression is to be allowed and whose is to be censored?

I have dealt with point a) at length in my book. With respect to point
b) there are two unspoken assumptions underlying this claim. First, that
we live in a democratic society, and second that the library is somehow
(simply through claiming IF as a value)
immune to state tendencies towards censorship, that despite being
institutions of the state, the library's commitment to absolute
intellectual freedom somehow protects it from taking sides on any
political or social issue. In this sense, while the state may have
tendencies towards authoritarianism, the library upholds the pure values
of the liberal state and the social contract: the state, in this view,
is an entity that sits above civil society, mediating disputes between
worldviews and values, but otherwise staying out of the way. Vickery
Bowles put this explictly in one of the
[statements](https://torontopubliclibrary.typepad.com/news_releases/2019/10/city-librarian-statement-on-upcoming-third-party-room-rental-event-.html) around the Meghan
Murphy room booking event:

>While TPL encourages public debate and discussion about differing ideas, we also encourage those with opposing or conflicting viewpoints to respectfully challenge each other’s ideas and not the library’s democratic mandate to provide space for both.

In other words, disagree with each other, but *don't you dare* disagree
with the library - we are above all disagreement and we know best.
 
In this model, civil society has debates that the liberal state in the
form of the library stands above. The library is a space which *allows for* the
practice of democracy or authoritarianism, but does not *do* democracy
or authoritarianism itself. It's a nice idea, and it underpins many of
the bourgeois conceptions of the state and the library. But as we saw
yesterday when hundreds of protesters descended on the Palmerston
branch, the veneer of neutrality, of not taking sides, of not protecting
one side at the expense of another, is as thin as vellum. Before the
protest even happened, Bowles had decided to call the police - the
authoritarian, repressive arm of the so-called "democratic" state down to a
public library branch. "When they're on site, they're in charge," Bowles
told Matt Galloway, in the timeless spirit of state complicity. What happened next was predictable: protesters
were kettled and held against their will inside a public library.
Adorno's deathless shame attaches to everyone involved in the decision
to bring the police into the library, but it tarnishes even more those
who claim that their defense of absolutist intellectual freedom is
somehow to *protect* people from state violence. Intellectual freedom
takes a back seat to intellectual dishonesty.

We don't live in a democratic state: we live in an authoritarian state
which manages the affairs of capital to the detriment of people's lives
and the planet. Rather, we live in what Antonio Negri calls a
*constitutionalized* state, in which the unlimited power of the
multitude, the community itself, to decide its own values, its own
direction, its own fate is strictly limited by the act of
constitutionalizing power itself. Such limitations are done to protect
capital, patriarchy, white supremacy, ableism, and a host of other
inequalities. What we saw last night, on the other hand, was the
spontaneous expression of real democratic power, of a community coming
together to act according to its values. They ran face to face with the
power of the constituted state, the power of the public library as state
agency, the power of the police as state violence. Negri calls such
powers "constituted" in that they have been set up above and in
opposition to the self-directed power of the multitude, of the commune.
The protesters last night were the directly democratic voice and
activity of a community, and they exposed the public library for what it
really is, simply another form of the constituted state. All the
rhetorical myths about democracy and protection against the absolutist
state were exposed to the harsh light of day as soon as the library
called the cops against a community expressing its will.

The library does not represent a commmunity, it represents only the
structures of oppression integral to the maintenance of white,
patriarchal, capitalist power itself. This was seen yesterday at its
most clear and unambiguous. The defenders of absolutist IF need to take
a good hard look at their arguments. Hopefully they will realize that
using China or Russia as the bogeyman of an authoritarian state is
simply the most calculating misdirection, intended to turn our attention
away from the transphobic abuses of our own country. I am not hopeful
that they will take such a hard look.

The TPL room-booking issue has exposed a deep and long-standing
faultline within librarianship. It has been building for some time (the
ALA "hate groups" debacle and the OIF's defense of it; Meghan Murphy's
talk at Vancouver Public, and CFLA's defense of *that*; the Winnipeg
Public Library draconian search policy, whose end is not yet in sight),
and it's unsurprising that the lines in the sand have been drawn around
this particular issue. TPL is Canada's largest library system, and
there was a test run two years ago with the Kulaszka memorial. There is
no indication that the constituted power of librarianship recognizes the
divide or sees any validity in any of the critics. The speed and
alacrity with which our professional organizations, public library CEOs,
and even *consultants* have closed ranks against having to think about
any of this, repeating ad nauseam they same tired old tropes about
democracy and free speech, means there is little hope to be found in
constituted power, as always. As always, however, the road forward must
lie in constituent power, the constituent power that was on display last
night as protesters took out books by trans authors, sat on the ground,
and began reading to each other. That is the power of the book that we,
as librarians, have forgotten in our mad dash for innovation and to
placate our purse-string holding overlords. That is power of commmunity
that we lose when we think of ourselves as standing *above* the
community rather than being a part of it. 

I think the solution for
librarianship is to embrace constituent power, setting up forms of dual
power in resistence to the state, recognizing that we must be part of
our commmunities and with our communities deciding for ourselves "what
is to be done". No more organizations or associations which, as Michels'
noted, have no choice but to become oligarchs. No more self-satisfied
complacency on the sacred role of the library in democratic society. There was a lesson to be learned last night as the
constituent power of protest met the fist of the constituted power of
the public library. It's up to us to learn the lesson and put it into
practice. And we can't rely on the old guard of librarianship to do this
with us; in the best sense of constituent power, we will have to do it
for ourselves.
