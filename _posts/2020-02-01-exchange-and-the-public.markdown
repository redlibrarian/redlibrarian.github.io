I've been rereading the [Weld v. Ottawa Public
Library](http://canlii.ca/t/j2dt3) Ontario Superior Court decision, as well
as [Allana Mayer's post about
it](https://allanamayer.tumblr.com/post/188589979137/libraries-and-room-rentals)
and the more I think about it, the more I think this decision completely
undermines the legal justification of TPL's and VPL's decisions rent
space to transphobic speakers in the face of community opposition. The
libraries can and will continue to stand by their interpretation of
professional ethics, but considering so much weight has been put on the
*legal* requirement for them to rent space to absolutely anyone (even when their own policy
countermands this), it's important to spell out the consequences of this
decision.

I've written
[elsewhere](https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2019/10/13/commmunity-value-worth.html) about the pernicious privileging of "exchange" as
the primary, if not the only, recognized social relation, a consequence
of the development of capitalism Marx and Engels recognized as far back
as 1847. In effect, Weld v. OPL uses the primacy of exchange to undercut
any presumption that room rentals have a *public* character. The
libraries that try to use exchange as plank in their defense of
intellectual freedom are, in effect, hoist with their own petard.

Weld v. OPL was a request on the part of Madeline Weld and Valerie
Thomas for judicial review of OPL's decision to revoke a room rental for
the screening of a white nationalist film based on its contents. Weld
and Thomas claimed that the termination of the rental a) was
procedurally unfair and b) violated their Charter right to freedom of
expression. It should be noted that OPL cited their room booking policy
in their decision to terminate the agreement, a policy that is very
similar to the one Toronto Public Library adopted after the Kulaszka
memorial.

The court not only denied Weld and Thomas' claims, it denied that there
were even grounds for a judicial review. In other words, the court
denied that there was even a role for it to play in adjudicating OPL's
application of policy, because the library was not acting *publicly* in
this case. The most significant part here, for me, is around
this question of exchange. The court found that an exchange is, by
definition, a *private* transaction, not a *public* one, and that a
private act of exchange need not (indeed cannot) be a matter of public
scrutiny. Obviously, this changes depending on whether the exchange
contravenes the criminal code (i.e. fraud) but in general the law leaves
exchange as a private transaction. Needless to say this conforms to the
liberal and neoliberal conceptions of exchange, contract, and
individualism, and so is very definitely open to critique, but under the
current regime, we can state that the opinion of the law is that
exchange is a private matter.

The reliance on the First Amendment (in the US) and the *Charter* (in
Canada) presupposes that a public library only acts, and *always* acts,
in a public sense, or as a government institution. What this decision
tells us is that, in Canada anyway, public libraries *can and do* act as
private parties to an exchange or contract. The reliance on the
*Charter* as a defense of public library actions then becomes much less
clear cut. In this case, the court found that the *Charter* rights were
not violated (see the paragraph on censorship below).

As a *private* matter, room rentals, then, do not - and cannot - fall
under the purview of the Public Libraries Act. The Public Libraries Act
determines what library activities must be (and remain) public, and that
those activities must be provided free of charge, i.e. they cannot be
exchange relationships. In *Confronting the Democratic Discourse* I
argue that restricting public library services to taxpayers in fact
makes public library services exchanges, but this is not how library
services are generally understood. In the case of room rentals, then,
the library is not acting as "Public Library" but as the private owner
of space for rent. To bring professional ethics to bear on (basically)
one's activities as *landlord* is perverse, but it also exposes a sharp
contradiction in how libraries see their role under capitalism.
Discursively, they want to remain "arsenals of democratic culture", but
in reality, they want to participate in the *private* and *undemocratic* economy of rent.

This contradiction, I think, lies at the heart of the confusion public
libraries have, not only around their values, but around their responses
to community pressure. They can't *openly* avow that their room rentals
are private exchanges with the library as landlord, and so they continue
to rely on the discourse of IF, professional ethics, and democracy. And
they (as we now know) rely on the institutional authority of, for
example, the Ryerson Centre for Free Expression which, after the release
of documents this week under the Freedom of Information Act,
we know is just shilling for its friends. The democratic
importance of intellectual freedom is reduced to an underhanded defense
of the public library as landlord.

Finally, as Allana pointed out, the denial of a room rental (I'm going
to stop using "room booking" or "hosting" for any transaction of this
kind) cannot be censorship. Despite the libertarian lineage of
censorship adopted by the ALA, the Office of Intellectual Freedom and
(it seems) Canadian libraries, not everything is censorship. As many
critics of IF absolutism [^1] have pointed out, it can't be censorship if the
information remains freely and widely available. One of the cornerstones
of libertarian definitions of censorship in, for example, the ALA's
*Intellectual Freedom Manual*, seems to be the *power* of the library to
affect information dissemination or access. However, as the Ontario
court found, in the case of a movie screening (and, by extension, a talk
given by someone with a website and podcast), 

>The Ottawa Public Library has no power or authority over the applicants.  They are free to seek out another venue for screening the movie. In fact, the applicant, Valerie Thomas, was able to see the movie in another location in another city.

Since denial of a room rental did not prevent Thomas from gaining access
to the information, it was not censorship, and it did not contravene the
*Charter*.

Obviously, libraries need to be careful about the ways in which
information access can and is restricted (for example, we must continue to
address issues of digital divide), but this is not an all or nothing
question. Indeed, part of the problem with IF discourse in librarianship
is that so much of it is black and white, leaving no room for the kind
of nuance many critics of absolutist IF bring to the discussion. As long
as those critics are routinely ignored and dismissed out of hand, the
kind of uncritical use of professional ethics to justify harmful
activities and private exchange will continue to devalue the
profession.

I should make it clear that nothing I've written here should be read as
approval or justification of a system of private property. What I want
to point out is that *even within the terms of capitalist law and the
institution of private property*, the public libraries' insistence that
they are legally required to rent space to anyone is completely
unfounded.

[^1]: I've been criticized for my use of the term "absolutism". How ironic to find, then, that it was in fact used by Michael Gorman in his book *Our Enduring Values*.
