In an early defense of TPL's platforming of a transphobic speaker,
Vickery Bowles made the rhetorical move from the usual library term,
"intellectual freedom", to "free speech", a term with particular
political connotations and a set of adherents who range from centrist liberals to the most rabid alt-right white supremacist. This
rhetorical move was at best naive, at worst calculating and dangerous,
since it changed the nature of the argument from one of deplatforming
(not censorship) and the struggle between conflicting library values, to
one of right-wing propaganda, bringing the weight of bigots on the right
down on the heads of anyone who challenged Bowles' authority.

The irony - or perhaps the tragedy - of this rhetorical move, and of "free speech" absolutism more generally, is that
its adherents, in libraries and in the alt-right, claim speech as the
ultimate overriding freedom while fundamentally not believing that words
or the ideas they convey have any power at all. It is doubly ironic that
so many of the alt-right adherents of free speech absolutism are
writers who, you would think, would be professionally committed to
taking words seriously. But in the end, they are nothing more than the
dishonest, disingenuous shills Sartre described in *R&eacute;flexions sur la question
juive*:

>"The antisemite evades responsibility [to value things] like he evades his own conscience; and choosing for himself a petrified permanence, he choses a morality of petrified values. Once done, he knows he will always be at the top of the [moral] ladder."

It is bad enough for writers to devalue  words, but it is doubly sad when
librarians do it. If librarians deny the power of words, refuse to take
words seriously, then how can we defend the practice of reading? What is
the point in collecting books and texts, in teaching literacy (including
information literacy), if the power of words, language, and the ideas
they represent is denied?

The most the defenders of free-speech absolute can grant is that words
cause "offense" or "hurt people's feelings". For example, in his [blog
post](https://cfe.ryerson.ca/blog/2019/10/social-justice-requires-intellectual-freedom-why-toronto-public-library-should-refuse) for the Ryerson Centre for Free Expression, Jim Turk cannot move
beyond "offensiveness":

>I am among those who find Murphy’s views offensive. But, then, I must confess I find many people’s views troubling and offensive these days. The question is, in a democratic society, whether anyone’s offense at someone else’s expression gives the right to prevent others from hearing it in a public place. The answer is “No.”

When I was on the CFLA Intellectual Freedom committee, my attempt to get
people to see *harm* as opposed to mere offense was never grasped or
granted. But as Meredith Farkas has noted in her [recent blog
post](https://meredith.wolfwater.com/wordpress/2019/11/04/when-libraries-and-librarians-pretend-to-be-neutral-they-often-cause-harm/), harm
is a real, material effect of speech:
>"I
can’t even fathom what all this feels like for LGBTQ+ staff at the
Toronto Public Library who are not only being harmed by this, but in
whose names these harms are being perpetrated."

Words cause effects - that any writer, reader, or librarian can deny
that is indicative of the fundamental dishonesty of the free-speech
absolutist position. And, just as Roy Bhaskar argued in *The Possibility
of Naturalism* that social structures are real precisely because they
have causal power, the causal power of words is bound up in their social
reality. Denial of the power of words, reducing their causal effect to
offensiveness and hurt feelings, is a denial of the reality of words:
something no writer or librarian can subscribe to in good faith. 

Indeed, such causal power was recently the subject of sustained
criticism of Boris Johnson in the UK, where he was repeatedly called out
for continuing to use divisive, militarized language ("surrender",
"treason", "betrayal") around any challenge to his Brexit "plans",
language which other MPs argued, passionately and persuasively, were
causally connected to death threats and violence against MPs. Johnson
[refused to
apologize](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/25/pm-branded-a-disgrace-after-saying-best-way-to-honour-jo-cox-is-to-deliver-brexit) for his remarks about murdered MP Jo Cox. Another MP described Johnson's language being repurposed in a death threat:

>Jess Phillips, the Labour MP and women’s rights campaigner, highlighted an anonymous death threat she had personally received, quoting Johnson’s image that he would rather be dead in a ditch than fail to deliver Brexit. “That is what will happen to those who fail to deliver Brexit,” it said.

Johnson, of course, true to the bad-faith dishonesty and recklessness of
the alt-right, denies that his words have any causal effect in the
world.

Words have causal power. The only way to deny this, other than outright
dishonesty, is for political purposes, or out of the ignorance of
privilege. These two characteristics are often combined. Boris Johnson,
Jordan Peterson, anyone who writes for Quillette can safely deny the
causal power of words because they wield an even greater power: the
power of wealth, class, gender, race - the privileges that have
insulated them their entire lives from any of the violence that attends
those without such privilege: marginalized people, poor people, queer
people, people of colour. In short, they can deny the causal power of
words because they are never on the receiving end of the kinds of
violence that, for example, trans people face daily. When brought face
to face with testimony to such violence, as Vickery Bowles and the TPL
board were last month, they are incapable even of recognizing it, let
alone understanding it or changing because of it. Indeed, free-speech
absolutists like Vickery Bowles are able to deny the power of words
because they are immune to them - quite literally, words are wasted on
them.

On the political side, the denial of the power of words is bound up with
populist adventuring, the lighthearted wish to consign social relations
to the flames of sectarian violence, secure in the knowledge that, like
Jacob Rees-Mogg, you and yours will always come out on top. We know that
radicalization of white terrorists in the US and Canada happens online,
amid the language and texts of other white supremacists. Politically,
the editors of Quillette want the world to burn, and they are happy to
egg it on, all the while hiding behind a fundamentally dishonest
insistence that the power of language is limited to offensiveness and
hurt feelings. Tell that to the victims of the Charleston Church
Shooting, the Orlando Nightclub Shooting, the Quebec City Mosque
Shooting, or the victims of anti-trans violence. 

But of course there is an even deeper level of dishonesty here, in that
at the same time as denying the causal power of words, free-speech
absolutists use words to whip up their followers, to radicalize, to
steal elections. Denying the power of words, of speech, of language is
simply a way to hide from the consequences of speech. The reason they
come out so hard against deplatforming, calling it censorship, is
precisely because deplatforming is a consquence, and they want no
consequences for speech except for other people to get hurt. Immunity
for themselves, and hell for everyone else. It's not just dishonesty,
it's cowardice.

Returning to Sartre, in his extended discussion of anti-semitism, we
find the phenomenon of free-speech absolutism in a nutshell:

>  Never  believe  that  anti‐
Semites  are  completely  unaware  of  the  absurdity  of  their 
replies.  They know  that  their remarks are  frivolous, open 
to  challenge.   But  they  are  amusing  themselves,  for  it  is 
their  adversary  who  is  obliged  to  use  words  responsibly, 
since he believes in words.  The anti‐Semites have the right 
to play.  They even like to play with discourse for, by giving 
ridiculous  reasons,  they  discredit  the  seriousness  of  their 
interlocutors.  They delight in acting in bad faith, since they
seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate 
and  disconcert.   If  you  press  them  too  closely,  they  will 
abruptly  fall  silent,  loftily  indicating  by  some  phrase  that 
the time for argument is past.  It is not that they are afraid 
of being convinced.  They fear only to appear ridiculous or 
to prejudice by their embarrassment their hope of winning 
over some third person to their side.
