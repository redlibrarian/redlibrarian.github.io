It was announced yesterday that the same transphobic speaker who rented rooms from Vancouver
Public Library and Toronto Public Library is scheduled to be on a panel
at Seattle Public Library. Seattle Public has responded to critics of this decision with the same trite defenses that VPL and TPL have, and will no doubt move to dismissing those critics as naive or confused, as per the usual playbook of library leadership. I thought it would be worthwhile rounding up my posts on intellectual freedom and the TPL event here, in reverse chronological order.
