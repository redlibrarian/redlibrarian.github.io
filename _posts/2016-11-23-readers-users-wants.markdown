I've been thinking a lot lately about the criticism that librarians tend
not to look outside their own field for inspiration, best practices,
cautionary tales, etc. This problem isn't specific to librarianship, of
course, but given our culture of "permanent crisis", looking beyond our
disciplinary borders (such as they are) might be a way to gain
perspective and strategy with respect to our mission and values. This is
even more important right now, as

points out, given that we could be (are?) facing the greatest test of
both mission and values in many years. Myron has also pointed out the
importance of economic understanding as we attempt to make sense of and
position ourselves in the world:

As a Marxist, of course, I'm all for looking at the economic
explanations for cultural phenomena, so I went back to Marx and other
economists who - in opposition to the dominant trend in bourgeois
economics - did not dismiss Marx outright. What follows, then, is an
attempt to give some economic weight to some trends in librarianship.

One of the sideshows of the [Berninghausen
Debate](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dann9311/610/610%20presentation.pdf) in
the 1970s, was the question of whether we should be exercising our
professional expertise in collection development or simply, as the
Baltimore County Public Library put it, 'Give 'em what they want'. This
argument was framed around professional responsibility and expertise:
who could judge the value of a given work to another person. With the
rise and dominance of approval plans and (more recently) patron- or
demand- driven acquisition, this argument has lost its urgency, but in
reality, it hasn't gone away, it has simply migrated to other areas of
librarianship. A good example of this is the prioritizing of "giving
students what they want" in academic libraries, both in terms of space
and services, and in terms of user-experience design for online and
digital services. This argument is also often framed as pitting
professional expertise (the curated LibGuide, for example) against the
needs and wants of "users" (however user is defined). In broader terms,
this is an argument around consumer choice - that capitalist canard that
becomes harder and harder to define the more its used. (Another example
is the current struggle over Library of Congress subject headings,
though the arguments there are significantly different, in my view).

When I was in library school, some of us argued that "what users want"
is socially constructed, and so collection development was ethically
required to take a social justice position with respect to acquisition
and "marketing" of stock. If all our "users" saw in the library was
material upholding the dominant (bourgeois) view of the world or
material that reinforced the role of our users as "content consumers",
then we were simply helping to reproduce the dominant ideology,
contributing to the social construction of the bourgeois subject itself.
Taking the position of "neutrality" simply help to entrench bourgeois
ideology, consumerism, and the values of capitalism. This argument is
based on what Marx would call "superstructural" phenomena - what we
would now probably call culture. But there is an economic argument that
can be made here as well.

In Paul Sweezy's 1942 book *The Theory of Capitalist Development* - a
Marxist rejoinder to Joseph Schumpeter's *Theory of Economic
Development* of 1911, he discusses the question of demand in Marxian and
neoclassical economics. Marx has often been accused of ignoring consumer
demand due to his focus on the forces and relations of production in
society. Sweezy argues that Marx recognized the important of demand, but
that it legitimately played little part in his economic analysis, partly
because consumer demand is itself determined by other economic
phenemena:

> Under capitalism, effective demand is only partly a question of
> consumers' wants. Even more important is the basic question of income
> distribution which in turn is a reflection of the relations of
> production or, in other words, of what Marxists call the class
> structure of society. (49).

In addition to this, Sweezy holds up Marx's materialist conception of
history (historical materialism) as supporting the playing-down of "what
users want" in Marx's economic theory:

> Wants, in so far as they do not spring from elementary biological and
> physical needs, are a reflection of the technical and organizational
> development of society, not *vice versa*. [...] If one is interested
> in economic change and if one accepts the position that subjective
> factors play an essentially passive role in the process of change, one
> can scarcely deny that Marx was justified in neglecting consumers'
> wants as he did. (51)

Sweezy supports this view with a quote from Schumpeter - definitely
*not* a Marxist economist:

> We will, throughout, act on the assumption that consumers' initiative
> in changing their tastes - i.e., in changing that set of data which
> general theory comprises in the concepts of 'utility functions' or
> 'indifference varieties' - is negligible and that all change in
> consumers' tastes is incident to, and brought about by, producers'
> action. (Schumpeter, *Business Cycles*, quoted in Sweezy, 51)

Now, librarians are not used to thinking about themselves as
"producers", or indeed of library workers as employees in firms (public
libraries, universities) which are producing and selling commodities.
However, if we *are* different than any other capitalist enterprise, we
have to engage with this idea straightforwardly. The time is past when
we could simply make comforting assumptions on this score.

With respect to users, however, there is an even more challenging
problem. We really have no choice but to meet the demands of our users
(whether they are students, members of the public, online users and
consumers of digital services). Usability, user experience, and design
are and will remain important focuses for libraries and library
services. But we have to come to terms with the question of consumer
demand - whether they are constructed, or self-generated; whether they
are spontaneous, or the effect of "producer action"; whether they
themselves are "neutral" or further reproduce patterns and structures of
capitalist domination. And no matter which side of the argument we come
down on, we have to think carefully about how we go about acting within
the context of our evaluation of consumer demand.

Now, I am not an economist. I'm sure there is a lot more to be teased
out in this area, and perhaps others in the library world have already
undertaken an economic analysis, not just of what our users needs are
(we already know we should be doing that), but of where our users needs
come from in the first place. However, I hope that as an exercise in
looking outside librarianship for ways of looking at an issue in our
profession, this was worthwhile.
