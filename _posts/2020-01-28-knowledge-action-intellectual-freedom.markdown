One of the main tenets of intellectual freedom absolutism is that the
library does not take a side, but instead provides a "neutral" platform
for the discussions necessary for social, political, and ethical
progress. Jim Turk, for example, has written that 

> it is vital that the TPL uphold public libraries’ commitment to the
> protection of intellectual freedom and refuse to cancel the event. To
> do otherwise may be popular with critics but will undermine one of the
> foundations for achieving social justice in Canada – freedom of
> expression.

Furthermore, the CFLA statement on intellectual freedom states that:

>Libraries have a core responsibility to safeguard and foster free expression and the right to safe and welcoming places and conditions. To this end, libraries make available their public spaces and services to individuals and groups without discrimination. 

"Foundations for achieving social justice", "safeguard and foster",
"makes available" - these are all passive, infrastructural ways of
describing libraries' role in society, and even though many supporters
of IF-absolutism deny that
neutrality remains at the heart of Canadian librarianship ("To my
knowledge, the library profession has never regarded neutrality as an
absolutist doctrine" - Alvin Schrader), this
passive language reflects an implicit hegemonic neutrality. More than
that, it sees the *effects* of library work as somehow divorced from the
actions of libraries themselves. Social justice, equality, even
questions of freedom and necessity, are things *other people* are
implicated in, while the library "simply" provides a framework. In
other words, the library sees itself as separate from and independent of
both the social forces in which it is embedded and the social effects of
its work. This is a natural consequence of the liberal theory of the
state which sees state institutions as outside of and above the
antagonisms of social relationships, mediating between them, but not
taking part in them. It is an extremely paternalistic view of state
institutions, one we see reflected in librarianship to this day. As we
will see below, however, there is no "outside" to neoliberal capitalist
social and power relations.

What this means is that on the one hand defenders of IF-absolutism (and,
implicitly, libraries) see the ability to "to
seek, receive and impart information and ideas" (from the UN Declaration
of Human Rights) as *in and of itself*
contributory to social progress. Put another way, having access to more
information - increasing knowledge - should *automatically* lead to
improved social relations and social conditions. This is the kind of
idealism Marx and Engels critiqued in *The German Ideology*, and which I
have written about before.

However, at another level, what is at play here is the inability of
IF-absolutists and libraries to connect their own positions within
capitalism with the effects of their work. I've written in *Confronting
the Democratic Discourse of Libraries* about how libraries are quick to
claim responsibility for *positive* social effects, but just as quick to
disavow responsibility for anything negative. The library as active
subject, in these cases, sees itself as distinct from its object (the
support and dissemination of harmful ideas and the reinforcement of
dangerous social relationships). We can see this most explicitly in the
constant denial that renting rooms to bigots is an endorsement of
bigotry by the library. 

This ties in with work Jana Bacevic has been doing on the epistemic
characteristics of neoliberalism. In her 2019 article ["Knowing
Neoliberalism"](https://doi.org/10.1080/02691728.2019.1638990), Bacevic
argues that *criticism* of neoliberalism has always been able to position
itself as *distinct* from neoliberalism, seeing itself as a form of
resistance or an agent of change, or at any rate independent of the
concrete realities of neoliberal power relations and ways of knowing.. However, she further argues that
neoliberalism has channeled these forms of resistance entirely *into* critique
in order to neutralize them. Neoliberalism is amazingly adept at
dismissing critique as just another perspective of which it is
"tolerant". (We can see here an example of postmodern pluralism as the
"cultural logic of late capitalism"). If we think of libraries as sites of
knowledge production, not only the passive "foundations" of knowledge
acquisition, then IF-absolutism falls squarely into what Bacevic
describes as "the politically soothing, yet epistemically limited
assumption that knowledge automatically translates into action". The
result of falling into this temptation, which IF-absolutists and public
libraries continue to do, is that:

>Not only does this omit to engage with precisely the political,
>economic, and social elements of the production of knowledge elaborated
>above, it also eschews questions of ambiguity and ambivalence generated
>by these contradictions.

Ambiguity and ambivalence abound in the current defense of
IF-absolutism. The
[statement](https://www.vpl.ca/statement-on-gidyvr-event) released by
Vancouver Public Library defending (once again) its decision to rent
space to transphobic speakers, is full of such ambiguity and
ambivalence. For example "VPL recognizes the importance of freedom
of expression as a core principle of democracy, and identifies it as an
organizational value. We believe that dialogue, not censorship, will
ultimately lead to greater understanding and inclusion". There is a
contradiction here, not only between the enshrined values of the
library (intellectual freedom vs. community), but between (yet again) freedom and necessity. I have written
before about the ways in which bourgeois freedom ignores the concept of
necessity. However, more important is the explicit illustration of what
Bacevic is pointing out: the idea that more information necessarily
leads to positive action.

Libraries believe, in the first place, that different or unusual (or
offensive) views and opinions are by definition critiques of the status
quo, and secondly that by providing a neutral platform for these views,
libraries are contributing to this critique, holding (neoliberal)
capitalist society to account. This is because, in a postmodern sense,
a plurality of micronarratives by definition challenges the primacy of
"grand narratives", the totalitarian closure of modernism. More opinions
are considered politically effective because they challenge the single
hegemonic position of the state or dominant culture. Libraries, in this
sense, are quintessentially (neo)liberal and postmodern institutions. 

However, libraries are concerned only with the *form*
these opinions take (reducing every perspective to a homogeneous "critique") rather than their content. The ambiguities and ambivalence arise
precisely from the contradiction between such views and the reality that
libraries are an integral element in the social and intellectual
reproduction of capitalist society itself, a society rife with
intolerance, cruelty, and exploitation. Again, liberalism sees the state
as mediating these antagonisms, but it is not the state's place to *do*
anything about them (see above on the "infrastructural" view of the
library's role). 

In this sense, then, IF-absolutism and neutrality
are the means by which the libraries hide this contradiction from
themselves; and, indeed, "social responsibility" and critical librarianship are the
means by which libraries' self-criticism is defanged and brought back
into the "politically soothing" liberal fold. As someone engaged in this
kind of critique, this naturally raises important questions for my own
position, and the effectivity of my own critique, but the problem does
not go away simply by ignoring it, retreating to the soothing platitudes
of our own privilege. Ignoring contradictions does not make them go
away.

Two recent cases should help sharpen the ambiguities active within
public libraries' position on intellectual freedom. In the first place,
despite claiming that unless a law is broken the public library is
*required* to rent space to anyone, an [Ottawa court has
ruled](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/court-upholds-librarys-decision-to-cancel-screening-of-controversial-film) that
Ottawa Public Library is *not* obligated by the Public Libraries' Act
to rent space to anyone who asks, for any purpose. Any legal advice
libraries are receiving to the contrary is pure risk-aversion for the
sake of protecting the brand (an outcome which is currently backfiring).

Secondly, the screening of an
[anti-vaccination](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/anti-vaxx-documentary-misinformation-alberta-1.5442573)
documentary at public libraries puts libraries in a very dangerous
position. While TPL board members were unmoved by testimony by
trans women of the dangers they face in Canadian society, the lives of
trans people continue to be at risk; dismissal of this reality as simply "being offended" marks trans lives as worth less than others. Public libraries seem satisfied with
supporting reactionary and dangerous opinions when trans people are
being hurt, but what happens when people the library actually cares
about start to die? Will libraries continue their misguided
IF-absolutism when white suburbanites start dying because of a
documentary they watched at a public library?

Libraries *must* begin to engage fully with the social,
political, and economic contexts of knowledge production, dissemination,
and acqusition. They can no longer hide behind abstract commitments to
bourgeois intellectual freedom and neutrality. As calls for Indigenous
sovereignty and the climate catastrophe become more urgent, libraries
will need to decide which side they are on. As someone remarked
regarding the VPL statement, no amount of "inclusive" posters undoes the
harm of making space for (and, yes, endorsing) bigoted speakers.

One final thought: IF-absolutists often argue that critics of bourgeois
IF are crypto-fascists or quasi-totalitarians, happy to let state
censorship into the library. This, however, is the horseshoe theory
taken to its utmost extreme. I, for one, already see the library as an agent of
the state; what I am arguing for - what many people are arguing for - is *commmunity* decision-making,
*community* guidance, grassroots allegiances, and anti-authoritarian
relationships. Looked at in this light, the formalism of public
libraries must be challenged, actions that appear (formally) to be the
same must be differentiated. Censorship by the state is *not*
the same as the self-determination of the community (and even the
Canadian courts recognize that refusing to rent space is not
censorship). In his book on constituent power, Negri writes that while
conspiracies and plots are corrupt and dangerous when they are done by
the state, "a plot is virtuous when it is democratic, because democracy
is always virtuous". Libraries need to abandon their spurious, liberal,
statist view of democracy - which is, in fact, anti-democratic, and turn to the absolute democracy of the
multitude. More information and better knowledge cannot overcome the
contradictions at play in libraries and in the profession; only concrete
material transformations of our social relationships. Libraries have an
opportunity *right now* to be a part of such transformations, but only
if they can recognize themselves as active participants in the
reproduction of both the intellectual and social bases of social life.
