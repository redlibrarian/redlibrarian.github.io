For 2021, I've decided to refresh my website. As a result, I will no
longer be maintaining redlibrarian.github.io as of January 1, 2021. I'm
going to leave the blog up so that all the posts remain available. After
January 1, 2021 new blog posts, etc, will be available at <a
href="https://spopowich.ca">spopowich.ca</a>.
