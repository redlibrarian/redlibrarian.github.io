In a Guardian article from this past Friday, Marina Hyde
[asked](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/16/conservatives-party-boris-johnson)
the question "What are the Conservatives conserving?" I've been reading
some of the classic statements of conservatism recently - particularly
Edmund Burke - and I think I've come to a realization: today's
conservatives are not conservative at all, in the sense that Burke (or
more modern representatives, like Oakeshott) would recognize.

For both Burke and Oakeshott, conservatism is not an idealogy, or a
philosophy, but a disposition to maintain (conserve) what one loves. In
a nutshell, society should be maintained as it is because one belongs to
it, to its traditions, to its familiarity. When conservatives offer the
argument - as Burke does in the *Reflections on the Revolution in
France* (1790) - that people are happy in the current social order,
respect it and approve of it, it is easy to return the criticism that
Burke is speaking only of privileged people like himself. Burke is
*wrong* that the majority of "free Englishmen" approved of the social
system - the history of poor and working-class social unrest in England
shows that.

But nevertheless, whether Burke is right or wrong about that, his
position is only conceivable in a period when England still adhered to
the traditions, values, and "antient" authorities that have produced it.
Put simply, one can only *conserve* what one *has*, so conservatives can
only be conservative in a society which conforms to (their view of) its
ancient constitution, laws, and social relations (Burke is also wrong
about the antiquity of England's constitution, laws but that's also
beside the point here). This raises the question of whether one can
still be conservative in a world transformed by capitalism and its
"liberal-democratic" political system? I don't think you can, at least
in politics. 

Once, as Marx and Engels put it, the revolutionary force of the
bourgeoisie has caused "all that is solid to melt into air", once the
democratic revolution that raised Burke's ire has spread throughout the
capitalist world, there is nothing left to conserve, and so
conservatives become merely one more voice in the liberal plurality.
Given that the state of social affairs they want is not in place any
longer (if it ever was), conservatives are simply one more voice
proposing social change. That they are *regressive* social changes does
not make them any less transformational, therefore by definition
unconservative. Furthermore, conservatives have adopted much of the language
and theory of liberalism - individual rights, for example, which would have shocked
Burke - so in reality those we call conservatives today are really
right-wing liberals. And given the opportunistic flexibility of
liberalism, this leaves very little to choose between them. (It is for
this reason that liberalism can be understood as paving the way for
fascism - fascism is just the openly authoritarian form of right-wing
liberalism). 

We can get a good sense of the difference by looking at, say, austerity
conservatives, looking to slash social programs in the name of balanced
budgets and individual responsibility. This kind of conservatism is
really no different than libertarianism, an offshoot of liberal theory
produced by the neoliberal turn, except sometimes in the question of the
"minimal state". Burke's warning of the threat of
democracy describes austerity conservatism to a t. Burke writes

>One of the first and most leading principles on which the commonwealth
>and the laws are consecrated, is lest the temporary possessors and
>life-renters in it, unmindful of what they have received from their
>ancestors, or of what is due to their posterity, should act as if they
>were the entire masters; that they should not think it among their
>rights to cut off the entail or commit waste on the inheritance, by
>destroying at their pleasure the whole original fabric of their
>society; hazarding to leave to those who come after them, a ruin
>instead of an habitation.

Burke's criticism was of democrats, but it applies even more to
contemporary conservative parties, like the British Tories and the
various Canadian conservative parties. They may describe their social
programmes as a return to "the good old days", but this does not make
them any less engaged in social transformation.

All this makes [Cass Sunstein's
article](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-10-17/if-biden-wins-progressives-should-listen-to-conservatives?utm_content=view&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic) on the good-faith reasons
conservatives might be opposed to social reform quaint if not outright
ridiculous. Sunstein claims that should Biden win the US election,
"many republicans might want to go back to basics and recover some of
the foundations of conservative thought" such as Burke and Oakeshott.
According to Sunstein, these "basics" include opposition to social
reform, and Sunstein adduces a book by the economist Albert Hirschman to
inform us of the "rhetorical moves" conservatives employ to justify
their opposition. The three moves in question are familiar ones,
appearing in both Burke and Oakeshott:

>Perversity: "many seemingly appealing reforms are self-defeating; they
>hurt the very people they are supposed to help".

>Futility: It "is not that reform efforts will have perverse effects; it
>is that they will have no effects".

>Jeopardy: "Progressive reforms will undermine, destroy or imperil
>important values and hard-won gains".

However, given that today's liberal-democratic society does not conform
to the kind of world Burke and Oakeshott were interested in conserving,
what today's conservatives propose is not a status quo justified in the
name of the perversity, futility, or jeopardy of social change. Rather,
today's conservatives want to transform society in a libertarian or
fascist direction. These three "rhetorical moves" are cynical attempts
to rationalize or convince others (the media, say, or the electorate) that right-wing liberalism is a good faith
attempt to deal with the modern world. 

Someone raised a question recently as to why the GOP has such a
preponderance within American discourse, and the answer I think is
precisely this kind of cynical rhetorical justification. By calling
themselves conservative, by positioning their social views as *already in
existence and of ancient provenance* (or even, as Burke does, "natural"), they put the onus on
liberals/progressives to justify their own social agendas. This places
conservative parties discursively in the driver's seat, even though the
world they claim to be conserving is long dead and buried. It is then
easier for them to push through their own radical and destructive social
policies (e.g. austerity) in the name of a return to "tried-and-true"
values or "natural" truths.

Similarly, the hegemony of liberal theory, as I said in previous post,
puts liberal political thought in the driver's seat with respect to the
left, forcing any
"radical" position (Marxism, feminism, Critical Race Theory) into the
position of challenging a dominant incumbent. 

In my own province, the right-wing liberals of the United Conservative
Party are currently commiting just the kind of depradation Burke warned
against. It remains to be seen whether, in the name of a conservatism
permanently allied with Burke's name, they reduce the "habitation" of
Alberta into a ruin.
