the COVID-19 crisis has brought the question of the role of the state
back into sharp focus. Under neoliberalism, the state is reduced to an
almost Robert-Nozick-style minimum, its role simply to steward the
economy (almost exclusively through fiscal policy and free trade
negotiations alone). The neoliberal state is a dialectical negation of
the big welfare state, making the state nothing but the administrator of
a smooth expansion of profits.

But this administrative regularity, ironically enough, created the
conditions for an expansion of state apparatus and control. The
expansion of state intervention in the name of safety and security
differed from the welfare state version because, as per neoliberal
orthodoxy, it was market-based. Citizens under the neoliberal state
essentially traded tax-dollars for services (which is why the "taxpayer"
holds such semiological weight in neoliberal society). Unfortunately,
like so much else under neoliberalism (money, for example), the services
themselves are often fictitious, existing nowhere but in the rhetorical
figures of government spokespeople and corporate PR officers (and belied
by the state and settler violence meted out to Black and Indigenous people on a daily
basis). And in any
event, the COVID-19 crisis has exposed the fundamental inadequacy of the
model: both in terms of government spending and in terms of the
unconscionable differential effects on oppressed populations. The
gender- and race-differentiated effects of lockdown, not to mention the
social and mental health effects, are also not amenable to a
transactional market-based model. Indeed, they directly expose the
inhumanity of such models.

So far, so Foucault. The idea of government as service-provider is at
the heart of Foucault's concept of governmentality. The society of
discipline gives way to the (free-market, alienated) society of
governmentality. Think about mask wearing. In societies of discipline,
the state would not have [shied away from fully mandating
masks](https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2020/08/26/proceduralism-and-mandates.html), with
severe (and often physical) penalties for those who did not comply.
Under neoliberalism, however, the government stops short of a
full-mandate, relying on the transactional idea of trading mask wearing
for safety which any "rational choice actor" ought to reasonably opt
for. When that fails, they rely on a vague and futile version of social conformity
and pressure ("we're all friends and neighbours, we need to look out for
each other"). Almost fifty years of the neoliberal erosion of social
relationships in favour of market relations, the implanting of
alienation, isolation, and anomie as a way of life, has come back to
bite them: social relationality can no longer be counted on to do the
right thing independent of any individual desire.

Indeed, the government has taken the place of this social relationality;
expanded to fill the void with its services, regulations, and technical
administration. Hence the idea of the government cancelling hallowe'en.
Hallowe'en isn't a government service, but a social practice. It is not
in the government's purview to either enable it or to cancel it. But we
have become so accustomed to thinking in those terms, witnessing the
return of the big state despite neoliberal dismantling of social
services. In this sense, the administrative state is a kind of "return
of the repressed" for neoliberalism, a symptom of its underlying
contradictions. 

Something needs to be done, obviously. There must *be* a response to the
pandemic, but it is significant that we look to the government to
provide that response. Someone on Twitter tweeted that it was "literally
the government's job" to impose mandates and penalties on people to
control the pandemic. To argue for less state intervention risks arguing
for the right-wing minimal state and no social services. So it looks
like we are in a bind: the only alternative to state intervention and
control in all aspects of our lives (why should the state have anything
to do with Hallowe'en?) is right-wing austerity and minimal-state
fascism.

But the expansion of the state is of very recent vintage, dating back
pretty much only to the Second World War. The double bind of
neoliberalism: enormous state control or right-wing libertarianism
obscures the fact that there is a third option. We don't have to be
full-blown anarchists to recognize the possibility of self-directed
social organization. It's a hard sell, looking back over fifty years of
the erosion of society in the form of neighbourhoods, solidarity, etc,
but the possibility still exists. 

Yesterday, for example, thousands of Alberta health workers walked off
the jobs in illegal wildcat strikes. My understanding is that this
strike was not only illegal (good - we need more illegal strikes) but
possibly also against the direction of union leadership. If that is the
case, then these wildcat strikes were truly the expression of collective
discontent, collective organizing, collective decisionmaking. 

In the 1960s in Italy, an "extraparliamentary" left movement arose that
did not look to any of the "traditional" institutions of
left-organization (parliament, parties, or unions) but looked instead to
an autonomous self-organization of people to forge their own path.

We can have a more widespread version of that, but the possibility is
hidden by the (illusory) double-bind mentioned above. And it is true
that one of the reasons we have needed a big state - both the welfare
state and the neoliberal administrative state - is that, cut off as the
vast majority of us 
are from the land, from the means of production, and from each other, it
is literally impossible for us to survive without some form of state
administration and redistribution.

But this only makes it all the more critical for seizing the means of
production to be the foundation of a programme of social justice. We
have to be able to support ourselves without relying on commodity
exchange and consumption (i.e. trading our labour-power for food) or on
precarious, corrupt state redistribution programmes. The ability of
capitalism to make alternatives invisible or undesirable is extremely
powerful, but we should not let that obscure the fact of new horizons of
opportunity that don't rely on the shell-game protection racket of
choosing between capital itself or the capitalist state.

One objection to the self-directed anarchist, anarcho-communist, or
"libertarian socialist" model is economies of scale: only the apparatus
of a fully modern nation state with its technocratic governmental
bureaucracies and systems can, it is argued, address widespread external shocks to the
system (whether that be virus or economic crisis or something else). But
we are witnessing, under COVID the dishonesty of that argument. The
incompetent cruelty (cruelty does not have to be efficient) of, say, the
Johnson and Trump governments, is a warning for the future of capitalist
government. 

Might we need to rein in our desires? Definitely. Will our
social forms need to shrink to, say, municipal or neighbourhood size?
Likely [1]. But such transformations only appear undesirable because we are
inured to the capitalist logic of expansion and unfettered desire. I've
been reading Ursula K. LeGuin lately, and it always seems as though - as
with so much good science fiction - her work is an attempt to keep a
utopian door open to horizons of other possibilities, to help us work
through our fears of unknown futures to show us the ways in which such
futures could be OK. In this sense, "Always Coming Home" is perhaps the
most appropriate science fiction novel of our time.

In a world where "utopia" has become another of the
words capitalism makes us afraid of (as opposed to the lean, worldy, efficient
pragmatism of, say, John Gault or Elon Musk), Fredric Jameson
(another devotee of science fiction) [reminds us](https://newleftreview.org/issues/II21/articles/fredric-jameson-future-city)
that it is always possible - even good - to "witness the attempt to imagine capitalism by way of
imagining the end of the world". Only right now we don't have to
imagine.

[1] There is a risk here of an eco-fascist interpretation of this which
would argue for the sacrifice of disabled people or people in the
capitalist periphery to make this work. To be clear: I'm not advocating
that and I don't think it would be in some perverse sense "necessary".
