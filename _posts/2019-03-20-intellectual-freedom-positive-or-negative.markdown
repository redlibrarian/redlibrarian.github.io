On this blog I am very critical of what I see as a hegemonic view of
intellectual freedom, a view which arises out of a mainly unquestioned
liberal perspective. My main criticism is that this view employs an
abstract value - "freedom" - divorced from social, political, and
material realities in an attempt to intervene in real social, political,
and material relationships and processes. As a Marxist, I believe
such a separation is impossible in practice, and that promotion of an
abstract or neutral conception of freedom merely serves to hide or
obscure underlying - often unconscious - social and political values,
allegiances, and ideologies.

But for the sake of argument, what I want to do here is to interrogate
the principle of intellectual freedom not from a Marxist, but from a
liberal perspective. To begin with, we should look at the United Nations
Declaration of Human Rights definition of intellectual freedom, which is
the definition adopted by, for example, the Canadian Federation of
Library Associations and the ALA. Article 19 of of the Human Rights
Declaration states that:

>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

This article conflates what are sometimes thought
of as two separate rights: intellectual freedom per se, and freedom of
expression. It also suggests that opinions can somehow be held "without
interference" (is education interference?), and that the only
significant obstacles to access to information are media and frontiers.
The article does not recognize the social provenance of opinions
(perhaps drawing on a Lockean theory of the human mind as a blank
slate), nor does it recognize the social nature of information access,
except with regard to media and borders.

But what I find most interesting here is that information freedom is
presented here as what Isaiah Berlin calls a "positive liberty", the
*freedom to* do something. In "Two Concepts of Liberty", a landmark text which has been very
influential in liberal thinking around rights and liberties, Berlin
distinguishes between positive and negative liberties, and defines
negative liberty as follows:

>If I am prevented by others from doing what I could otherwise do, I am to that degree
unfree; and if this area is contracted by other men beyond a certain minimum, I can be described
as being coerced, or, it may be, enslaved. (...)  The criterion of oppression is the part that I believe to be played by other human
beings, directly or indirectly, with or without the intention of doing so, in frustrating my wishes.
By being free in this sense I mean not being interfered with by others.
The wider the area of noninterference the wider my freedom.

On the other hand, Berlin defines the positive conception of liberty as
follows:

>The 'positive' sense of the word 'liberty' derives from the wish on the part of the individual to be
his own master. I wish my life and decisions to depend on myself, not on external forces of
whatever kind. I wish to be the instrument of my own, not of other men's acts of will. I wish to
be a subject, not an object; to be moved by reasons, by conscious purposes, which are my own,
not by causes which affect me, as it were, from outside.

The positive conception of liberty, then, is clearly predicated on the
usual methodological individualism of liberal political theory: that
the world is made up of rational individuals who decide for themselves
how to act without reference to to any other person or cause.

Leaving aside the Marxist critique of this position - that human beings
are born into a pre-existing society, a set of social relations, a
culture, and an ideology - what is interesting here is that the
methodological individualism requires that we take no notice of the
effect of our actions on other people. Berlin talks about the corruption
of both these conceptions of liberty, if we start to imagine that our
rationality and our capacity to decide and to act is done in the name of
other people, or done in the belief of the irrationality, ignorance, or
impotence of others. It is clearly this risk that article 19 it meant to
mitigate, and the history of intellectual freedom in libraries is the
history of attempting to protect the rights of others in the face of
encroachment (possibly with the best intentions) on the part of the
state, concerned parents, etc. This is the same reason why "Freedom to
Read" week is almost exclusively focused on book challenges.

What gets ignored here - and this is due again to liberalism's
individualistic ontology - is the fact that the exercise of a right does
not exist in a vacuum. There are social consequences to every action, no
matter how rational and "individual". So the positive exercise of
"freedom to hold and express an opinion" automatically comes up against
a negative freedom, the freedom *from* being exposed to toxic,
dehumanizing views. This freedom is not enshrined in the Human Rights
Declaration - it may be a liberty we can conceive of, but it is not
entrenched in legislation as a right under article 19. 

However, if we define negative liberty as freedom from discrimination -
a modern spin on Berlin's coercion, but not, I think, an unwarranted
one, then *Article 7* of the HRD *does* offer such a protection, reframed as a
positive right:

>All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination.

When the ALA explicitly inserted "hate groups" into their room booking
interpretation last year, they argued that this was in order to make
public library systems compliant with the first amendment. It was framed
as a freedom of expression decision (article 19), but it explicitly
contravened article 7 (hate groups, by definition, discriminate or
incite to discriminate).

From a liberal point of view, all this requires is a sense of balance, a
respect for toleration. "Neutral" libraries are expected to take an
objective stance balancing freedom *from* discrimination with freedom
*to* express even the most heinous of opinions. But notice how article
19 refers only to opinions, information, and ideas. Again, liberalism
since the time of Descartes, maintains a strict division between the
mind and the body, ideas and the real world. This Cartesian dualism
forms part of what Antonio Negri has called the "reasonable ideology" of
the bourgeoisie. From the liberal perspective, ideas and opinions can
(and must) be defended without limitation because they *quite literally
do not affect the outside world*. The liberal view of intellectual
freedom, then, is quite powerless, quite ineffective, at a total loss
when faced with very real consequences of opinions and ideas in the real world.
Liberal philosophy can make no connection between
white-supremacist ideas and the murder of Black people; between the
denial of climate science and the approaching climate catastrophe; between
transmisic opinions and the suicide of trans people. The liberal
conception of intellectual freedom is *inadequate* to a world in which
ideas have real consequences; it is inadequate for the real world
itself. It is this inability that explains why libraries and
organizations like the ALA's Office of Intellectual Freedom keep making
the same kinds of mistakes.

Article 7 gives libraries a way to protect our staff and users from
particular opinions, ideas, and speech. If we are going to rely on the
HRD for article 19, then it is legitimate to lean just as heavily on
article 7. However, this would require abandoning the liberal
perspective on "freedom", "neutrality", and the strict division between
thoughts and consequences. It would require abandoning methodological
individualism and committing to something like the IWW motto, "an injury
to one is an injury to all".
