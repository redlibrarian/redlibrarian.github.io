(NOTE: I have gone into the question of intersectionality and identity
in more detail in chapter 2 of *Confronting the Democratic Discourse of
Librarianship* on "Vectors of Oppression").

I don't pay much attention to OLA's *OpenShelf*, but when [John Pateman's
post on identity politics and intersectionality was sent to me, I felt I
had to respond](https://open-shelf.ca/2004-06-open-for-all-intersectionality/). I am automatically suspicious of any "political" statement, especially one that claims a radical or progressive political position, that supports the dominant line of the profession and of public library management (Pateman is CEO of Thunder Bay Public Library). 

Pateman's post fits squarely into recent debates around deplatforming and intellectual freedom which I've argued before has exposed a division within the profession that is in at least some senses generational. These "generations" are not merely categories of age - we've seen examples of generational divide between feminist waves, and there are definitely "generations of Marxism" which disagree not only on details but sometimes on the fundamental approach to politics. I've critiqued Pateman's  *OpenShelf* posts before, and I've
come to the conclusion that much of our disagreement stems precisely from our
generations of Marxism. While there are definitely synchronic
disagreements within Marxist tendencies (Marxist-Leninists see a lot of
things very differently from, say, anarcho-communists), the diachronic
or generational differences can be just as striking. Previous generations
of Marxists, like previous waves of feminism, can find it hard
to deal with certain questions around identity, especially when
intersectionality is brought into play.

However, I came away from Pateman's post with the distinct impression
that he doesn't understand what intersectionality *is*. At one point, he
refers to it as a "form of politics", and he seems to equate it with
what he understands as "identity politics" [^1]. For Pateman identity politics
seems to equal intersectionality, and both these things are isolated
from and independent of something else called class politics. While
Pateman allows that "there is also a class dimension to
intersectionality", in fact he holds these categories as separate
things,
related, if at all, only externally. This, to my mind, indicates a
static, formal understanding of the network of concepts, rather than a
properly dialectical one. For Marx, such external opposition of concepts
was the mark of vulgar or dogmatic criticism rather than true critique,
and I think that, unfortunately, is what Pateman is engaged in here.
True critique must look beneath the surface categories to understand how
they came to be, what political issues they were summoned to confront.

If identity politics and intersectionality are *not* the same, what is
their relationship? Luckily, the ~~concept of~~ term[^2] intersectionality is
traceable back to its origins: Kimberl&eacute; Crenshaw's 1989 article
"Demarginalizaing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist
Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist
Politics". Crenshaw argues that any category of identity when taken in
isolation serves to bury the differences that categorize Black women's
experiences. For a Marxist, the burying of differences must be
recognized not only as mystification but as deeply political, and should
not be ignored. Crenshaw writes that "neither Black liberationist
politics nor feminist theory can ignore the intersectional experiences
of those whom the movements claim as their respective constituents. In
order to include Black women, both movements must distance themselves
from earlier approaches in which experiences are relevant only when they
are related to certain clearly identifiable causes (for example, the
oppression of Blacks is significant when based on race, of women when
based on gender)". I think Pateman is falling into the same trap, seeing
class oppression as only relevant when it is based on class position,
rather than recognizing the intersectionality of class itself. More
importantly, Crenshaw suggests that identity politics is *not* the same
as intersectionality, a suggestion she makes explicit in a later paper,
1991s "Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and
Violence against Women of Color". "The embrace of identity politics,"
she writes, "has been in tension with dominant conceptions of social
justice. Race, gender, and other identity categories are most often
treated in mainstream liberal discourse as vestiges of bias or
domination - that is, as intrinsically negative frameworks in which
social power works to exclude or marginalize those who are different.
According to this understanding, our liberatory objective should be to
empty such categories of any social significance. Yet implicit in
certain strands of feminist and racial liberation movements, for
example, is the view that the social power in delineating difference
need not be the power of domination; it can instead be the source of
social empowerment and reconstruction".

By my reading, Pateman is attempting precisely to "empty [identity]
categories of any social significance", for example when he writes that
"activist communities need to work harder to make it possible for people
of different classes, genders, ethnic origins, sexual identities, etc.
to be together in respectful and beneficial ways." It is hard, for
example, to
understand how a Marxist can propose the idea that "people of different
classes" should "be together in respectful and beneficial ways" without
emptying the concept of class of all its social and political
significance. What is class-struggle besides the *rejection* of such
tolerance.

But for Pateman, as for many Marxists of previous generations, class is
not an identity. It is, rather, an objective economic category, a
position within a relationship of objective, scientifically readable
process (production). But, as Marx famously said, "all science would be
superfluous if the outward appearance and the essence of things directly
coincided". Class is an economic category, to be sure, but it is *also*
an identity - how else can we explain ideology and class-consciousness.
Workers would not need to develop class-consciousness if their class
position was immediately transparent to them; workers would always
identify as workers, rather than adopting the ideology that allows them
to identify with the bourgeoisie. Put another way, class as economic
category is available to us *as an identity*. It is hard to understand how
a Marxist could make this claim about identities other than class without seeing that working-class politics does this all the time: "Call-outs, shaming, and other forms of “weaponized” communication shut down conversation and political debate, and more importantly, limit the number of social spaces where differing points of view can be heard and respected". We would not include capitalists or management in a union meeting, precisely because we *already know* what they are going to say based on their class-identity, and respect for another's position, in this case, is detrimental to class politics and gives up class struggle without a fight. Pateman seems to imagine the possibility of a progressive politics without struggle, an odd position for a Marxist to take.

Besides the privileging of class as objective over identity as
subjective, I suspect that Pateman is also making one of the
foundational mistakes in the Marxist playbook, one Marx identifies and
analyzes at the very beginning of *Capital*. Marx calls the process of
mistaking social relations for things (social relations of production
for commodities, for example) as *fetishism*. Georg Lukacs, in a nuanced
exploration of this idea, refers to it as *reification*, making *things*
out of social relations. Pateman has made the same mistake here, thinking
of "identity politics" and "intersectionality" as things ("identity
politics selects...", "intersectionality is here to stay...") rather
than as social relations. It suggests that, in fact, Pateman doesn't really
understand what identity politics or intersectionality are. That
identity politics, like all progressive politics, is recuperable and
actively coopted by capital is no surprise: class politics is not immune
to this, why should identity politics or the concept of
intersectionality? What is more important than looking at the surface
(reified) manifestations such as call-outs or deplatforming, is to
understand the roots of identity politics in oppression and
intersectionality as differentiated oppression.

Indeed, I suspect that what is going on here is a bracketing of class
oppression from other kinds of oppression (of race, gender, sexuality,
disability, etc). However, this is the kind of privileging of the class
experience of one particular kind of person - the white, male,
industrial worker - that feminist Marxists in particular have
challenged. Silvia Federici, for example, in her classic *Caliban and
the Witch* makes the historical case that, while Marx focused on the
experience of the male industrial worker in England, the truth of
capitalist development is that both colonial exploitation (and the
construction of race) and what Federici calls a genocide against women
were fundamentally necessary for the development of capitalism. Any
contemporary Marxism must then take the *intersection* of race, gender,
and class seriously. Intersectionality and identity politics do not come
out of nowhere, are not unconnected with real lived experiences and
structures of oppression, but reflect real social and power
relationships present within racialized and patriarchal capitalism[^4].

Unfortunately, I think Pateman's critique of intersectionality is not
only based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept, but that it
is based not on a commitment to a politics of the disenfranchised, but
on tone-policing. When Pateman writes that "It’s hard to see how people
in deprived communities can get excited about a form of politics that
regards much of what they think, say and do as a form of abuse", it
indicates not only the misundertanding of identity politics, but also
that the crux of the matter is the question of tone. It is also a
straw-person, identity politics is no more marked by regarding what people
think, say, and do as abusive than any other form of politics. Indeed,
we just have to look at the treatment of April Hathcock at [ALA Midwinter
in
2019](https://aprilhathcock.wordpress.com/2019/01/30/alamw-what-happened-and-what-should-happen-next/)
and the ALA's subsequent response to understand how important an
intersectional approach is, and how tone policing often spills over into
abuse in and of itself.

Pateman's undialectical reification of the concept of intersectionality
leads to another straw-person argument: that intersectionality and class
politics must be "reconciled" so they "work in tandem". "Both theories must have equal billing going forward, or they will become exclusionary." Much of the best work in Critical Race Theory, feminism, and contemporary Marxism already do this work of "reconciliation", but reconciliation is in fact the wrong word[^3], as it implies the smoothing out of contradictions, tensions, and differences. In fact these differences, while they may be painful, are immensely productive, and so what is needed - and indeed, what is being done - is not a *reconciliation* of differences but a properly intersectional reckoning with them. The work of W.E.B. Du Bois and Frantz Fanon, among many others, shows how race and class interlock; the work of Federici and Nancy Fraser, among many others, shows how gender and class interlock; the work of Crenshaw, among many others, shows how gender and race interlock. There is no shortage of "identity politics" work that displays precisely the kind of nuance Pateman accuses it of lacking. And this is not only true of academic work: intersectionality is present in the best radical antiracist anticapitalist egalitarian movements. Pateman's worry about co-option is not unjustified, but his fear that poor and marginalized populations and communities will be put off by identity politics or intersectionality is unfounded.

More worrying, though, is how Pateman's fundamental argument falls in
line with the dominant conception of intellectual freedom and neutrality
in libraries. I've come to realize, in my reading of recognition
politics, that the reason libraries absolve themselves of responsibility
for what gets said in them is that they see their role as purely one of
platform: they bring together differing points of view and ensure that
the rules of civility and respect obtain. Pateman's post supports this
perspective and does not recognize the structural role libraries play,
the enormous power imbalance at work, and the harm done by libraries in
legitimating harmful perspectives. This too is a problem with
generations and identity: to identify as a librarian is to uphold the
core values without question; previous generations of "critical
librarians" see critique as properly directed *outside* the profession.
As a result, they are at a loss when the critique is directed at the
profession itself. 

There is no fundamental dichotomy between "identity politics" and "class
politics", they are already related: any contemporary Marxism must (and
indeed, does) take intersectionality seriously. The category of identity
is not distinct from the category of class. As a result, there is no
need to "bring them together" unless, for some reason, you have
already split them apart, reifying them, and falling for the
mystification inherent in reification. What Pateman is afraid of is not,
I think, identity politics and intersectionality properly understood,
but the same tired "lack of civility" backed by an unconscious dimissal of
race or gender, sexuality or disability as structures of real oppression and harm that marks
liberal centrist politics in the current conjuncture. As I have
[mentioned before with respect to "community-led
libraries"](https://redlibrarian.github.io/introduction/2016/05/10/public-libraries-history-state.html),
Pateman's own view of the politics of libraries is easily recuperable to
a politics of austerity and neoliberal dismantling. I suspect this is
because he continues to believe in the democratic discourse of
librarianship, and sees the proper target of critique outside the
profession. However, it is becoming more and more clear that the work
being done in the current generation of critical librarianship -
critiquing the profession itself - is a turn whose time has come not a
moment too soon.

[^1]: I'm tempted to think of identity politics as a "boundary object", i.e. in this case a concept which is sufficiently flexible to mean particular, sometimes incompatible things, in different contexts, but which is well-enough defined at a larger scale to be recognizable.

[^2]: Thanks to David James Hudson for pointing out that while Crenshaw may have coined the term, the concept of intersectionality had been around in Black feminist circles like the [Combahee River Collective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combahee_River_Collective) in the 1970s.

[^3]: Indeed, Marxism already has a concept that comes close to intersectionality: [overdetermination](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1962/overdetermination.htm)

[^4]: Just as wrong in this context as it is increasingly exposed as inadequate to settler-Indigenous relations in Canada.
