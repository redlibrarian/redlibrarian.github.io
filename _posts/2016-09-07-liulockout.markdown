And only a couple of months later we have the example of the [Long Island
University faculty/librarian
lockout](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/nyregion/liu-brooklyn-locks-out-professors-amid-contract-dispute.html?_r=0), which
has several interesting features. On the one hand there's an almost
unprecedented (in academia) resorting to classic union-busting maneuvres (short-notice
lockout, obstruction of communication through blocking access to faculty
email, scab labour), but there's also a tactic which seems especially
heinous to those of us north of the border: the unilateral and immediate
cancellation of health insurance. At this point, the tactics of
university administration tips from being ugly but still within the
bounds of traditional labour disputes to - at least from a Canadian
perspective - a criminal act.
It is no longer the ability to work and organize that is being
disrupted - Russian roulette is being played with people's lives.

It is in this context that I think it is actually dangerous to ignore or obscure the fact that
the needs, wants, and missions of administration (whether at the library
or the university level) are not the same as those of faculty,
librarians, and staff -
especially in, but not restricted to, periods of collective bargaining. To pretend otherwise puts not only livelihoods at risk but also, as in the LIU case, actual lives. 

It was argued that the CAPAL statement on collegial governance was meant
to be read as an aspirational document. It strikes me that aspirations
should be framed using "ought" language, no matter how idealistic that
sounds ("the university ought to be a democratic organization"). To
frame an aspirational document in "is" language is either disingenuous
or dangerously naive. An aspiration is inherently idealistic, otherwise
it would be a programme (of change, of revolution, of reform), so there
is no need to shy away from idealistic language.

It is much clearer to point unambiguously to the inequities of power,
especially as labour disputes sharpen along with the depths of
capitalis and ecological crisis in both Canada and the US. That such a
crisis is deepening can be seen in the more-or-less open warfare on
workers (especially workers in weaker positions, according to race,
gender, sexuality, poverty) in the US. Cancelling workers' health
insurance is tantamount to putting a gun to their heads to force them to
approve a "collective" agreement (the bourgeois euphemisms become
positively obscene in a time of crisis).

However, it is important to bear in mind that in universities, absent an
actual owner, administration is composed of workers too. Coopted by a
capitalist system that has even reached our institutions of higher
learning, they are acting according to the requirements of the system.
So too with scab labour. There was some debate yesterday about the
justice of calling "replacement workers" scabs, and it is again vital to
remember that calling in scab labour (Marx's "industrial reserve army")
has a higher function than merely replacing labour power: it is to
divide and disorganize workers themselves, setting them against each
other in order to weaken their opposition to the real power - that of
capital itself. I have no problem using the "scab" language, if only to
combat the prevalence of mealy-mouthed bourgeois euphemisms like "labour
action" instead of "strike", but we have to remember that scab's
*especially* are put in a terrible position by capital. In the LIU
situation, replacement workers are drawn from ununionized positions and
threatened with termination for noncompliance. The violence of the
relations of production touch unionized workers, that is beyond dispute,
but unionized workers have to look out for nonunionized workers too,
even scabs, who are often in an even worse position.

And on that note, might we hope that a lockout of faculty might convince
some of them that they too are workers, that their privileged
socio-economic position behooves them to act in solidarity with all
other workers in the university? One of the main tactics of capitalism
is to divide and conquer through offering better standards of living to
some and not to others, but it is important to remember that these
standards of living are granted by capital on sufferance, they are not
the just desserts of some intellectual essentialism.

These are just a few thoughts, not fully worked out. I felt it was
important to write something up about the LIU faculty and librarian
lockout, in solidarity.
