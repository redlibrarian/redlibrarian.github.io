<p>Just a quick update on the status of the book I’m currently writing on
the democratic discourse of librarianship. The book now has a <a href="http://litwinbooks.com/books/confronting-the-democratic-discourse-of-librarianship/">publisher
page</a>
and an expected publication date of May 2019.</p>

<p>Next week I’m presenting the basic argument of the book at the Ontario
Library Association Superconference in a session called “Libraries and
Democracy: A Critique”.</p>
