<p>This is part three of a series of blog posts written in response to
Meghan Murphy’s room booking at Toronto Public Library. Read <a href="https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2019/10/13/commmunity-value-worth.html">part
one</a>

two</a>.</p>

<p>The debate around Toronto Public Library’s room rental to Meghan Murphy
continued over the long weekend, and today TPL responded with a <a href="https://torontopubliclibrary.typepad.com/news_releases/2019/10/city-librarian-statement-on-upcoming-third-party-room-rental-event-.html">new
statement</a>.
I don’t normally do this, but I think it will be useful to critique
specific phrases in the document. To be honest I’m too tired of this
argument to do anything else. Because public libraries don’t recognize
legitimate critiques of their intellectual freedom positions, they rely
on tired old tropes and positions, expecting the public to take them at
face value, when the public conversation has already moved on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While TPL encourages public debate and discussion about differing ideas, we also encourage those with opposing or conflicting viewpoints to respectfully challenge each other’s ideas and not the library’s democratic mandate to provide space for both.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know if this is clumsy phrasing or not, but the sentence
actually encourages people not to challenge “the library’s democratic
mandate”. Coming from a <em>state</em> institution, the injunction not to
challenge the library is extremely worrying. If we take the
“democratic” nature of Canadian society and public libraries for
granted, the right to critique and challenge is one of the most
sacrosanct values of democracy, even liberal-bourgeois democracy.
There’s something strangely authoritarian about a public library telling
people not to challenge it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a public library and public institution, we have an obligation to
protect free speech. When Toronto Public Library (TPL) makes meeting
rooms available to the public we serve, we need to make them available
to all on an equitable basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As usual, the fact that the library is embedded in capitalist social
relations means that it picks and chooses the kind of “equity” it
recognizes. Toronto public library <a href="https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/using-the-library/room-theatre-rentals/meeting-rooms.jsp">room rental
fees</a>
range from $23.24/hour to $156.86/hr. The “equitable nature” of room
rental is decided by TPL (not its community) on a financial basis. While
it’s nice that TPL charges less for non-profit than commercial renters,
it’s still the case that this excludes groups that may want to use the
room but can’t afford the rate. Additionally, “A valid credit card is
required to book a room”, further adding to the non-equity of room
rentals. TPL clearly feels it can pick and choose the criteria for
room-rental “equity”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TPL reviews the stated purpose of each third-party room rental request
to determine if it is in compliance with our Community and Event Space
Rental policy and the purpose of this room rental is, “To have an
educational and open discussion on the concept of gender identity and
its legislation ramifications on women in Canada.” The speaker for this
third-party room rental event has never been charged with or convicted
of hate speech as defined in the Criminal Code of Canada.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My old friend, positivism. Positivism in natural and social science
holds, essentially, that only something that <em>positively</em> exists counts
as evidence. This raises the question of where you look for such
positive phenomena. In this case it means taking the room rental request
at face value, and never looking at additional evidence (in order to
come to what you might “reasonably believe”). So while it
might be the case that Twitter banning Meghan Murphy has no immediate
implication here (since, as the statement points out, Twitter is a
private corporation), it’s understandable that people would expect TPL
to look beyond the words used in the room rental for the broader context
and background. Indeed, as a librarian, I would expect TPL to have
started with this kind of contextual research.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The event organizers are also contractually obligated not to violate TPL’s policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I wrote in a previous post, the contract is the only thing sacred to
a capitalist organization. It stands to reason that it is the only thing
TPL will count on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Libraries have always been committed to supporting vulnerable communities by welcoming and creating space for different perspectives, rather than through censorship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is another sentence that is difficult to parse, but perhaps it was
written in a hurry. However, there is a body of literature that belies
the idea that “libraries have always been committed to supporting
vulnerable communities”. Indeed, we don’t even have to look far back
into the history of libraries to show this (<a href="https://litwinbooks.com/books/confronting-the-democratic-discourse-of-librarianship/">although we
could</a>).
All we need to do is to point to the fiasco of the racist security
policies implemented at Winnipeg Public Library earlier this year. I
find it dreadful that this statement can appear in a 21st century public
library; libraries need to become more familiar with their own
histories, and less concerned about their communities challenging their
“democratic mandate”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of our core responsibilities is to safeguard and facilitate access to constitutionally protected expressions of knowledge, imagination, ideas, and opinion, including those which some individuals and groups consider unconventional, unpopular or unacceptable. Another is to make available our public spaces and services to individuals and groups without discrimination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except, as we’ve seen, financial discrimination, which is a cornerstone
of capitalist social relations.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The community is asking us to censor someone because of the beliefs they hold and to restrict a group’s right to equitably access public space and we cannot do either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the heart of the matter, I think. The community is not asking
the library to censor anyone. Indeed, by framing Meghan Murphy’s event
simply as a room rental which TPL neither supports nor condemns, TPL
admits as much. If the room rental is a value-free contractual exchange,
then at most TPL would be not entering into a contract, not censoring.
The library can’t have it both ways: if it’s simply a contract, then
no-platforming cannot be censorship; if it’s censorship, then it is not
merely a contractual relationship. Also, in an age of information
abundance, surely the library has a responsibility to distinguish
between those who already have a platform to spread their ideas (such as
a podcast) and those who genuinely rely on the library as a place to air
any of their ideas. Indeed, I think this would be a self-fulfilling policy:
insofar as we do not know someone’s ideas, they should be aired and, if
necessary, challenged; in so far as someone already has a platform, we
neither need to nor want to hear their views again.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We would also suggest that engaging in respectful civil discourse with people of opposing views may be a more productive strategy than abstaining from public library events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back to liberal dogma. As I’ve argued in my book, people are dying and
time is running out. The bourgeois insistence on endless debate,
discussion, consensus-building, etc, is deplorable in the face of both
these phenomena.</p>

<p>Going back to the question of positivism and the lack of awareness of
social and political context, by doubling down on the concept of “Free
Speech” in this statement, TPL <em>must</em> recognize how they are
discursively aligning themselves with the alt-right. And whether the
library wants it or not, the alt-right <em>will</em> weaponize that discursive
alignment. Libraries need to overcome the naive
<a href="https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2019/02/07/on-innocence.html">innocence</a>
with which they approach the social world, or they will rapidly find -
as Vancouver Public and Winnipeg Public have - that they have lost the
trust of those communities it is their “democratic mandate” to support.</p>
