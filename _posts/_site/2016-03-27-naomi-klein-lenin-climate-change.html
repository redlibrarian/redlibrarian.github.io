<p>Naomi Klein opens <em>This Changes Everything</em> with an anecdote about an
airplane prevented from taking off because its wheels have sunk deep
into the overheated tarmac. In this story and others, Klein sees an
important irony within the truth that is climate change:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The temperatures in the summer of 2012 were indeed unusually hot. (As they were the year before and the year after). And it’s no mystery why this has been happening: the profligate burning of fossil fuels, the very thing that US Airways was bound and determined to do despite the inconvenience presented by a melting tarmac. This irony – the fact that the burning of fossil fuels is so radically changing our climate that it is getting in the way of our capacity to burn fossil fuels – did not stop the passengers of Flight 3935 from reembarking and continuing their journeys. (<em>This Changes Everything</em>, 2).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This “irony” is a classic example of what Marxists refer to as a
contradiction. “Irony” implies something accidental or fortuitous about
how the state of affairs came to be: “look, we can’t burn fossil fuels
because we burn so many fossil fuels”. But a contradiction in the
Marxist sense never loses sight of the fact that the juxtaposition of
two truths such as these are far from accidental; they have, in fact,
been determined by the movement of history itself.</p>

<p>In Hegelian and Marxist dialectic, a contradiction is resolved through
“the negation of the negation” and the production of something new, a
new state of affairs. In this case, Klein’s title is well-chosen. In the
synthesis that resolves a contradiction everything is changed.</p>

<p>But Klein is not a Marxist, and her prescription for the kind of change
necessary to avoid the disaster that climate change is bringing ever
closer is not a materialist one. She recognizes that the change that
must take place is economic, but she hedges on the question of
whether such an economic change has ever taken place  (“I must report
that the answer to that question is predictably complex, filled with
‘sort ofs’ and ‘almosts’” (p. 453)) while ignoring the historical example
of the victory of the middle-class in Europe, precisely the kind of
social revolution which must occur if Klein’s vision of a “safer and more
equitable” society is to be realized.</p>

<p>But for Klein, the building of such a movement requires only that people
“open their eyes” in order to see the truth and begin to change the
structures of their lives and to demand political, social, and economic
change. But this was precisely the view of Feuerbach, Bauer, and Stirner
that Marx and Engels criticized in <em>The German Ideology</em>. In Klein’s view,
“a great deal of the work of deep social change involves” debates and
stories:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because if we are to have any hope of making the kind of civilizational leap forward required of this fateful decade, we will need to start believing, once again, that humanity is not hopelessly selfish and greedy. (p. 461).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, of course, raises the spectre of “class-consciousness” and its
place in the coming revolution. For Feuerbach, Bauer, and Stirner (the
“Young Hegelians” of Marx’s critique), all that was required for social
change was for people to change their view of the world. In <em>The German
Ideology</em>, Marx countered that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The relations of men, all their doings, their fetters and their limitations are products of their consciousness [therefore] the Young Hegelians logically put to men the moral postulate of exchanging their present consciousness for [another] consciousness, and thus of removing their limitations. This demand to change consciousness amounts to a demand to interpret the world in a different way, i.e. to recognize it by means of having a different interpretation. (* The German Ideology*, p. 36).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For Marx this was an untenable position. <em>The German Ideology</em> provides
the most detailed elaboration of historical materialism in Marx’s
writings, according to which the socio-economic change in society
resulting from the crises provoked by contradictions such as those cited
by Klein cannot be the result of a change in consciousness, because
consciousness itself is a product of history. While Marx agrees that a
wholesale change in consciousness is necessary for “the success of the
cause”, he argues that this change “can only take place in a practical
movement, a revolution” (<em>The German Ideology</em>, p. 60). The consciousness of
the class fighting for change can only come about in the process of the
revolution itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If [the] material elements of a complete revolution are not present – namely, on the one hand the existing productive forces, on the other the formation of a revolutionary mass, which revolts not only against separate conditions of the existing society, but against the existing “production of life” itself, the “total activity” on which it is based – then it is immaterial for practical development whether the idea of the revolution has been expressed a hundred times already. (p. 62).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For Klein, the elaboration and the communication of the idea (through
debates and stories) will be enough for her revolutionary movement to
come about. It does not seem to be that “a revolutionary mass” is
anywhere near existing in the countries where this revolution is
necessary (i.e. the countries of developed capitalism). But it seems
clear that the contradictions arising out of the juxtaposition of
climate change with advanced capitalism can only lead to more and more
crises, both economic and climatic, and that these crises may lead to
the formation of the revolutionary mass. But Klein is wrong to think
that “we will win by asserting that such calculations [of human life vs.
profit] are morally monstrous” (p. 464). No revolution ever came about
through the assertion of a fact.</p>

<p>Klein does seem to understand that, despite much of her programme being
framed as “demands”, at a given moment, actual power will have to be
taken. If we are watching for the contradictions to sharpen, for the
final crisis to come – as it must come – then there must be people ready
not only to “debate and tell stories”, though there is a place for that,
as there is a place for everything in Klein’s book. But there must also
be those who are prepared to recognize when the moment for the seizure
of power has arrived. This was, perhaps, Lenin’s greatest gift: the
ability to recognize the historical moment for what it was. In addition
to a movement like the one Klein envisages - coming before the
revolution like John the Baptist – we should be looking to the example
of Lenin in the realm of organization and the practical seizure of
power. When even non-Communists like Naomi Klein recognize the need for
revolution, when the crisis of climate change is visible and apparent in
our everyday lives, when the contradictions of capitalism are heightened
day by day, perhaps the lessons of October are once more relevant.</p>
