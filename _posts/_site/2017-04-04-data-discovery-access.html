<blockquote>
  <p>Library directors are increasingly recognizing that discovery does not
and should not always happen in the library. Compared to the 2013
survey results, fewer library directors believe that it is important
that the library is seen by its users as the first place that they go
to discover content, and fewer believe that the library is always the
best place for researchers at their institution to start their
research. The share of respondents who agree that it is important that
the library guide users to a preferred version of a given source
continues to decrease. <a href="http://www.sr.ithaka.org/publications/us-library-survey-2016/">Christine Wolff, US Library Survey

<p>According to the Ithaka S+R report for 2016, the proportion of library
directors who believe that their library should be the first place users
look to discover scholarly content is dropping, but the absolute numbers
remain high - above 50% in all three degree-areas.
This indicates that library directors continue to see resource discovery
as an important task for each individual library. In a recent post to
the BIBFRAME listserv, Osma Suominen of the National Library of Finland
wrote that “we can all agree that discoverability of bibliographic
resources is very important, whatever the means”. On the question of
whether discoverability or access should take priority, Suominen comes
down firmly on the side of discovery: “Even if it means users are
crashing into firewalls when they try to access the actual content, at
least they get to know that it exists and can then try other ways of
getting hold of it”.</p>

<p>To me, “at least they get to know that it exists” is the crux of the
problem with library discovery thinking right now. It’s a holdover from
the days when finding out if something had been written - either on a
particular topic, by a particular author, or, in the case of a known
item, when and where it had been published - required the use of Books
in Print or printed periodical indexes. “Discovery” - finding out what
has been written and published - was <em>hard</em>, and in the printed index
days was <em>by definition</em> the responsibility of each library.</p>

<p>But in a networked world, with bibliographic metadata already online and
available in many different formats and locations, we no longer have the
problematic, difficult, discovery workflow that we did with Books in
Print and periodical indexes. Answering those two questions: has
something been written, and where/when was it published, is trivially
easy. “Discovery” is only a problem when either, you want to be
<em>absolutely sure</em> you’ve found <em>everything</em> that satisfies your search
criteria (and nothing that doesn’t), or if you are trying to force users into a single portal that
satisfies their search requirements. The first case has likely been
impossible since the invention of printing, but is certainly completely
unrealistic today. The second case is connected to the point of view
that it is the library’s job to help users find out “whether something
exists”. Neither of these, to my mind, is a problem that needs solving.</p>

<p>Perfect precision and recall is possible on a small, well-described,
well-understood data set, none of which describes the non-trivial data
sets that we or our users work with on a daily basis. The Google,
Amazon, or Proquest corpuses are vast, opaque, and noisy compared to the
clean, sleek (and mythical) bibliographic databases of yore. More and
more, especially with newer search and indexing algorithms, precision
and recall seem to be a zero-sum game; that is, improvements in
precision lead to poorer recall, and vice versa. This is a problem for
no-one but librarians stuck in the days of Books in Print and periodical
indexes, when they could convince themselves that these sources provided
perfect precision and recall, which was not really the case then either.</p>

<p>With respect to the portal question, we have known for a while that our
users are making less and less use of our search systems for discovery.
It’s not that they are abandoning our systems for other things, simply
that they already have a way to discover resources. Forcing users out of
the “wild west” of the open web into systems which – we like to believe
– are clean and well-curated panders to <em>our</em> sense of (bibliographic)
control, but doesn’t in fact to anything to solve a discovery “problem”
– precisely because there is no discovery problem.</p>

<p>Rather than trying to “get our data on the web”, with every library
exposing multiple copies of the same overlapping data, either to allow
that data to be used by other systems or to drive traffic back to the
local library (the Zepheira model), there are problems that we can and should be addressing.</p>

<p>In the first place, there’s the question of bad, noisy data. Publisher
metadata is, generally, terrible, and is the prime obstacle to
good-enough discovery on the web. Can we help fix that problem by
exposing our data, either through APIs or Linked Open Data - yes, but
every individual library doesn’t have to do it; perhaps that is a role
best suited to OCLC or LoC (in the North American context; there are
other organizations to play this role in other parts of the world).</p>

<p>The library best use that I’ve heard of for exposing more Linked Open Data on
the web comes from Karen Coyle, who sees the ability to combine contextual bibliographic and
non-bibliographic information to a user’s workflow and experience. This
workflow and UI may not (probably shouldn’t be) implemented, owned, and
hosted by a library, but if it lives anywhere else, our data should be
one of the data sources in it. But again, this should not be the
responsibility of <em>every single library</em>. If libraries do decide to get in this game,
we are going to have to figure out our position with respect to portals,
since at the moment, this is not something that works in our favour.</p>

<p>Then there are our systems - this is the access question. We shouldn’t
accept that a user hitting a firewall and then trying to find a way
around it is good library service. Given our licensing ecosystem, our
systems need to recognize a user that “belongs” to us, and then remove
as many barriers to access as possible. We’ve seen with SciHub what a
user-interface designed to do that looks like. The duct-tape-and-glue
approach to library systems, based on early-90s interoperability, is no
longer good enough. We have the skills, expertise, and technologies to
design better systems for access; this is somewhere it would be
worthwhile focusing our attention, but in the age of link resolvers and
proxies that “work OK”, we aren’t bothering. (Note that for these
systems to work, the data on the web needs to be better, so this is
inextricably linked to the data question above).</p>

<p>Finally, as <a href="https://twitter.com/bibliocracy">@bibliocracy</a> points out,
there’s still a problem with how our users approach bibliographic
resources that <em>starts with</em> discovery but does not end there. I’ve
heard librarians talk about research as if it starts and ends with a
perfect set of search results from which a bibliography can be created.
This is patently ridiculous. More than discovering whether a resource
exists, our users have to want to <em>find things out</em> and they have to be
aware of the information context of the data they are navigating, with a
view to producing something worthwhile which may (or may not) in the end
be scholarship.</p>

<p>Too long, didn’t read version: “discovery” is not a problem that needs
to be solved; better data and systems for access are problems worth
tackling right now, but not at an individual library level; data,
discovery, and access will not - despite a librarian bias - produce good
scholarship; only good scholars can do that.</p>
