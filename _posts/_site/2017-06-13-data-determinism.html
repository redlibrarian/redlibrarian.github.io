<p>Yesterday morning, I was at the Canadian Open Data Summit (CODS), where a lot of
the discussion was around the benefits of open data for governance. Beth
Blauer from Johns Hopkins discussed her experience working in various
muncipalities in developing data infrastructure to support governance
decisions. This led to the following tweet from the Edmonton Mayor’s
Office:</p>

<p>The presumption here that open data <em>automatically</em> provides the
evidence required to solve socio-political problems is, I think, too
simplistic. It relies on a determinism just as dangerous as
technological determinism, in that it removes the human relationships
(i.e. the politics) from the questions of how the data is collected in
the first place and by whom. How are data elements defined? What is
considered <em>non-data</em>, with respect to the simplification of the
empirical world to the data model? These are all political questions,
implicated in dynamics of socio-economic power and domination. Ignoring
the political questions around the creation of data makes it easier, I
think, to ignore the political in the question of data use. Beth Blauer
talked about “the intersection of personal and public data”, essentially
talking about behavioural control based on mining personal data (search
history, calendars, medical records, school enrollment) with public data
(neighbourhood information, school information, weather data, etc). The
uncritical acceptance of the neutrality and truth of open data means
that we trust this intersection in the same way that we trust the
(filter-bubbled) Google results that are presented to us.</p>

<p>This feeds in to some thoughts I’ve been having about technology as the
mediator of the transition from the society of discipline (Foucault) to
the society of control (Deleuze). We can see in the recent US and UK
elections how false or spun data can manipulate (control) populations.
One effect of removing a visible human presence from the mediating of
technology is that a) data and algorithms become obscured and more
likely to embody “algorithms of oppression” (Safiya Noble’s term) and b)
technology is seen as both neutral and true when the human
determinations are made invisible. We like to think that a technological
solution is unbiased, and data driven technologies are considered to be
empirically sound and politically unmotivated. And data determinism -
like technological determinism - makes data the active driver of
behaviour and decision-making, by obscuring the political conditions of
its creation.</p>

<p>There’s also a rhetorical component to this. As with classic statements
of technological determinism (Ursula Franklin’s for example), data
determinism puts data as the subject in sentences. So when Dark Horse
Analytics tweets:</p>

<p>In this view, it is “Open Data” that “transforms” society, rather than the agency and
decision making of people. Data, like technology, can be a tool in the
transformation of society, but only people can do it. The rhetorical
strategy of making data the <em>subject</em> of sentence, makes data seem like
the subject of the acts themselves. From there, the invisibility of
human, political dynamics plays out as above. This is a classic case of
what Marxists call fetishism or reification, the method by which
relations between people appear as relations between people and <em>things</em>
(and often simply between things). In this way the social relations of
capitalis, which are relations of domination, exploitation, and
oppression, are hidden from view.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/chefquix">@chefquix</a> asked what was wrong
with data-driven decision-making. My argument is that if we presume data
to be objective, we ignore the decision making that went into the
construction and collection of the data in the first place. Just as we
have begun to think critically about the social relationships and biases
that go into algorithms[1] (something else engineers would like to think of
as objective), we need to recognize that the same mechanisms of
oppression and domination that are encoded in algorithms are encoded in
the ways we design our data collection. “Data” is not a natural
phenomenon, conveniently recorded, it is just as socially constructed as
anything else, and represents a model, that is a simplification, of the
empirical world that has been decided <em>a priori</em> (and often
unconsciously).</p>

<p>A perfect example of what I’m talking about came up at the afternoon
panel on “Open Data and First Nations in an Era of Reconciliation”,
which included three women - Leona Star, Mindy Denny, and Bonnie Healy [2] - involved in indigenous health initatives in
Manitoba, Alberta, and Nova Scotiat, and how assessment and measurement
in this area relate to sovereignty in general and data sovereignty in
particular. They argued persuasively about the ways in which cultural,
racial, and socio-economic prejudices (in the strict sense of
<em>judgements that come before</em> the collection of data) condition and
constrain the ways in which data are collected and phenomena are
described. In this case, the connection between the political decisions
that go into <em>constructing</em> data and the very real social, economic, and
political effects is starkly apparent. By presuming that “data” is an
objective reflection of the empirical facts, we end up supporting and
reinforcing the worldviews, biases and prejudices that create that world
in the first place. It is in this sense that “data-driven” can easily
elide into “data determinism”, in which the data that we believe to be
objective and value-neutral in fact props up the very world views we are
hoping to investigate. What began as a spurious, rhetorical data
determinism becomes a very real determinism, one which undermines many
of the social justice initiatives that are a core part of the open data
community.</p>

<p>[1] I honestly can’t wait for Safiya Noble’s <em>Algorithms of Oppression</em>
book, which looks like won’t be out until next spring sometime.</p>

or on the CODS website.</p>
