<p>An outside observer would be forgiven for thinking librarianship has a
culture of handringing.  Much ink has been spent in writing about
crisis, change, the future of libraries, the continued relevance (or
not) of something called “the library”. The move from a physical to a
digital information space has, it seems, called into question not only
the continued viability of “the library” but also its characteristics.
“The library” is not an inventory of books. “The library” is no longer a
physical space. Rhetorically “the library” takes the appearance of a
concrete thing, and one of the reasons the move to digital has caused
such existential anguish is that we do not understand how “the library”
might be represented in a decentralized, relational manner. There are
many, today, who are embracing the possibility of the non-physical
library (primarily through the mediating metaphor of the graph or the
semantic web), but even this embrace is seen as oppositional, as a
transformation of the physical library. Whether this transformation is a
good or bad thing is open to (seemingly endless) debate. But what I want
to talk about here is the idea that “the library” as a thing does not,
and never has, existed.</p>

<p>In his essay “Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat”,
Lukacs formulates the idea of reification, which is traditionally
understood as coming from Feuerbach’s critique of Christianity through
the materialism of Marx. Essentially, “reification” is the mistaking for
a concrete object a series of relationships between human beings. For
Marx, the problem of the reification of commodities was of primary
importance: the worker who produces coats does not merely produce an
object that someone can use to keep warm, but produces an object which
stands between and relates many different people in different kinds of
transactions: the worker herself, the factory owner, the distributor,
the retailer, the purchaser, the purchaser’s family, etc, etc. In having
the object stand in for all these relationships, the relationships
themselves become hidden by the object.</p>

<p>For Lukacs, however, the process of reification applied not only to
commodities, but  to “all subjective and objective phenomena” in
capitalist societies. I would like to suggest that “the library” itself
is a reification, a mystification of an objective whole for a network of
human relations that, when recognized as such, untangles all of the
problems associated with change and transformation, and clears up the
relationship between library work and the modern, digital world. One of
the problems with reification is that the objective vision becomes
trapped in a single aspect, when it can really only be understood
dialectically, that is, changing over time and in relation to other
things. By ascribing objective
characteristics to a thing called “the library” we attempt to make it
static, unchanging, so that as the world changes around it, our
understanding and recognition of it become increasingly contradictory
(the position in which we find ourselves today).</p>

<p>Another concept to support this idea of the library as social relation
is that of mediation. Jameson describes the classical view of mediation
as the “dialectical term for the establishment of relationships between
[…] the internal dynamcs of the political state and its economic base”
(<em>Political Unconscious</em>, p. 39), and I would argue that “the library” (as
a nexus of human relationships) occupies – and has always occupied – a
mediatory position between various economic realities (that is, the
reality of commodity production) and socio-political requirements. The
public library and the academic library differ in precisely what and how
they mediate these terms, but not in the fact of being themselves
mediations.</p>

<p>To take the academic library first, we must discuss the network of
economic (primarily financial) relationships that exist within the
university at large. Income in the form both of tuition and grants allow
students and researchers to participate an educational/research activity
which claims to be financially disinterested. The library’s role is to
take a portion of this income and provide access to resource and
services which are purportedly “free”. The ideology of librarianship
provides a set of workers who understand their role as facilitating
access to these resources and services with as few barriers
(technological, intellectual, financial) as possible. The library, thus,
stands as the nexus of relationships between politicians, vendors of
library resources and technology, faculty, students, librarians, etc. It
is these relationships that constitute the core of library work. “The
library” does not exist outside or beyond this network of relationships.
Even the library collection should be seen as the objectification of
increasingly expensive financial relationships between a whole host of
agents. The fact that all of these relationships are reified is present
in the language that we use: “we are managing the collection”, “we work
for the library”, “students use the library”, etc.</p>

<p>Such is the “reified” nature of the academic library as it stands in
2016, but what are the commodity relationships that the library
mediates?  The university is often understood as an institution that
provides an education and is more or less financially disinterested. In
truth, power and prestige of those who run universities is dependent on
the production of certain kinds of commodities (workers, buildings), as
well as on the circulation of money through various hands as part of the
massive fraud known as the financial sector (any investigation into the
relationship between banks, businesses, donors, and university buildings
will expose this part of the fraud). The library itself pays inordinate
amounts of the income of the university to private vendors of library
resources and technology, but presents those resources and that
technology as “free” to faculty and students. The academic library there
mediates between an academic system which is fully implicated in
commodity production and financial capitalism and a vision of the
university as altruistic and enlightening. The mediation is aimed
primarily at student and faculty population who provide a large part of
both the income and the labour of the university. The library, in the
end, mystifies or hides the real economic relationships between all the
agents who are connected to it.</p>

<p>The situation for the public library is slightly different. Public
libraries tend to be branches of the capitalist state (city government,
councils, etc), and part of the mystification of the capitalist state is
not only to appear disinterested, but to appear to provide social
services and increase the public good. However, they must also maintain
the cultural logic of capitalism among the general population. Public
libraries, then, play the role not only of seeming to provide a
disinterested, enlightened public service, but also to prop up ideas of
the value of entertainment, of consumer choice. Ironically, the free
provision of popular commodities through the public library increases
the fetishisation of those commodities, through implicit approval and
recommendation by an authoritative, trustworthy source. The
relationships objectified in “the public library” are fairly similar to
those of the academic library, but the economic reality and ideological
structures mediated by it are slightly different.</p>

<p>How can recognizing and exposing the reification of libraries and the
mediations they uphold help us in dealing with the economic, social, and
technological changes we are currently in the midst of? The answer may
lie in the concept of hegemony taken from Gramsci and Lenin. For Lenin,
and for many socialists of the 19th and early twentieth century,
capitalist domination was the domain of the state, and coercion was
predominantly effected through state violence. Lenin maintained,
however, that in order for the proletariat to lead all of Russia’s
exploited into revolution, the proletariat needed to achieve “hegemony”
over the other exploited classes. By this meant that the proletariat had
to recognize the needs and interests of the other classes and include
the satisfaction of those needs in its own political programme.</p>

<p>Gramsci offered a broader and more nuanced view of hegemony. For him, in
addition to the proletariat in the revolutionary movement, the dominant
class also exercised hegemony, in the form of cultural, intellectual,
and ideological values and norms. The ways people conditioned to think
about and act in society were conditioned, not directly coerced, through
state institutions like schools, churches, and political programmes
(today we would add marketing, professional sports, and entertainment to
this list). The library, both public and academic, also occupy spaces
within this network of state control of culture.</p>

<p>One of the code-words for hegemonic institutions is “trust”; libraries,
churches, schools, universities – these institutions are seen as bearers
of public trust in ways that that more directly coercive or political
institutions (like the police or the Senate) are not. Many articles have
been written about the perceived trustworthiness of libraries (two
examples
<a href="http://www.publiclibrariesnews.com/2012/08/librarians-second-only-to-doctors-in-public-trust-survey-finds.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-02/as-u-s-libraries-are-outsourced-readers-see-public-trust-erode">here</a>
). This position of trust indicates to me that libraries are indeed
hegemonic institutions, mediating between state power and the culture of
citizens.</p>

<p>But hegemony is a difficult thing to control and maintain, due in no
small part, to the fact that exercising state violence against cultural
institutions destroys the hegemonic effectiveness of the institutions,
while potentially increasing it’s cultural value (which, as <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-april-4-2016-1.3519317/librarian-under-house-arrest-in-moscow-accused-of-anti-russian-propaganda-1.3519352">recent news
out of Russia has
shown</a>,
does not prevent the use of state force entirely). Hegemonic spaces also
require the work of intellectuals in order to function, and
intellectuals, too, are not usually amenable to the usual channels of
state force. Hegemonic institutions, then, typically possess a small
amount of play, indeed require it for their hegemonic function to be
fulfilled. But this does not mean that libraries, schools, etc, are
automatically spaces of potential freedom from cultural domination. As
mediations, the characteristic of such spaces can only be driven by the
attitudes, consciousness, and work – indeed the very social relations –
of those who work in the library and those who use it. To answer the
question of how recognizing and exposing the reification of libraries
and the mediations they uphold help us in dealing with  economic,
social, and technological changes, we have to recognize not only the
hegemonic position of libraries, we have to understand, in the first
place, that the reification of libraries cements cultural domination and
must be resisted. Once the intellectual resistance to one kind of
reification takes hold, it can potentially be extended to cover the
reification of all other relations, and eventually the reification of
the commodity itself. But the library as mediation requires that library
workers consciously recognize themselves as working within hegemonic
institutions, as supporting the dominant culture and, in the end, state
power, coercion, and exploitation. Only by being very clear with
ourselves about that can we open up the minuscule space for resistance
inherent in hegemonic institutions, and the do the work of which
libraries are, I believe, capable.  This work can only be undertaken
together – library workers and users, no leaders, no followers – in
order to be able to think an alternative – any alternative – to the
cultural dominant of capitalism in the 21st century.</p>
