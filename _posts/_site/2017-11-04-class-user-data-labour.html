<p>This week there was a lot of discussion about the ethics of tracking
library users (specifically students) and passing that data along to
university administrations to help support the “student experience”,
ensure “student success”, and “prove the value of libraries”. There was
a lot there to get into - I recommend looking at the timelines of
<a href="https://twitter.com/libskrat">Dorothea Salo</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/bfister">Barbara Fister</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/donnalanclos">Donna Lanclos</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/librarianmer">Meredith
Farkas</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/panoptigoth">Angela
Galvan</a> for good, in-depth takes on why
this is a problem.</p>

<p>What sparked this conversation was a presentation at Educause 2017 on
<a href="https://events.educause.edu/~/media/files/events/user-uploads-folder/e17/sesso21/closing-the-data-gap--presentation-part-1.pdf">“Closing the Data Gap: Integrating Library Data into Institutional
Learning
Analytics”</a>.
Two of the questions posed in this presentation was “Are there correlations between
library use and student success measures? And how do you measure success?” The presenters argued that by integrating library use(r) data with other campus data, we could prove the value of library use. One of the slides contains the following quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The Libraries] are critical to supporting student
success, which is one of our highest priorities at the
University. Libraries researchers have gathered
compelling data that indicate that undergraduates
are more successful (as gauged by higher GPAs,
higher retention rates, and higher 4-year graduation
rates) when they use our Libraries. (Provost Karen Hanson

</blockquote>

<p>The twitter conversation was often critical of the political
naiveté of this position, exemplified in these two tweets (taken
more or less at random):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;They&#39;re panopticons, so let&#39;s do the

<p>What this particular discussion reminds me of are the debates around
industrial rationalization that took place on the Italian left in the
1960s. There was a sense that “rationalization” was objective, neutral
(sound familiar?) - that the increased efficiency produced by, say,
automation or time-motion studies (i.e. taylorism) were somehow
independent of the class relationships integral to the capitalist
organization of labour. Many on the left in Italy in the sixties -
enjoying an enormous boom in productivity and standard of living
following the difficult years of post-war reconstruction - argued that
improvements in productivity should not be seen as integrally connected
with capitalist exploitation or the domination of capital over labour.
Raniero Panzieri, editor of the “Quaderni Rossi” (Red Notebooks)
journal, argued that this point of view stripped particular developments
(time-motion studies, user-tracking) from their concrete position and
function within the struggle between labour and capital, which led to
seeing these things as objectively valuable, useful, and good, and only
put to bad use by exploitative capitalists. The dominant federation of
labour unions at the time maintained this position, seeing “time and
motion studies, ‘human relations’, even the restructuring and
parcellisation of the labour process [i.e. the assembly line]” as
possessing “an intrinsic rationality and necessity which their current
use by capital could never obliterate” (Steve Wright, <em>Storming Heaven</em>,
p. 42).</p>

<p>This view is mirrored in the library and higher-education world by those
who think that the good we can do by tracking and aggregating user data
outweighs the risk of that data being “misused” by (neoliberal) universities and the
corporate interests that are so embedded within them. I put the word
“misused” in quotes because the use of user/student data to increase the
exploitation of students - to turn them into workers, to rank, to order,
and to condemn the lowest performers - is <em>precisely</em> the proper use of
such data under capitalism. It isn’t so much that librarians are afraid
that this data may be handed over to the government or corporations
(though of course we <em>are</em> afraid of this, and rightly so), but that our
data is used to deepen and extend the quantification of education and
educational performance, and thereby the relations of neoliberal
capitalism itself.</p>

<p>Another tweet I came across which sums up the political naiveté
of those who think that any user tracking can be innocent is the following, which contains a slidefrom ARC17:</p>

<p>This point of view might have been innocent in the early days of the welfare
state, before the transformation of society into one large immaterial
factory took place, but in a world in which both data and the algorithms
that operate on them are being used to broaden, extend, deepen, and
solidify social control, inequality, exploitation, and domination, in
particular by previously “enlightened” or “progressive” institutions
like libraries or universities, such a position is no longer innocent,
but actively culpable.</p>

<p>Part of this innocence is, as I see it, due to a misrecognition on the
part of librarians (especially academic librarians) and faculty members
that we and the students are all part of the working class; we do not
own and control the means of production that we use every day - the
means of production are owned by the university or the government (what
Mario Tronti calls “the collective capitalist”), and we are brought
together with them every day in buildings they also own. The decline of
industrial production in North America has tended to mystify this fact;
we can imagine that because we aren’t industrial workers that we aren’t
workers at all. But in fact, the opposite has taken place. As Tronti
argued in his 1962 essay in Quaderni Rossi, “Factory and Society”, “When
all of society is reduced to a factory, the factory - as such - seems to
disappear”. What we do when we participate in logics of rationality such
as integrating our user data with other “learning management” data is to
spread the “factoricization” of the library and the university. We have
to learn that we are not, despite appearances, <em>outside</em> the logic of
domination and exploitation of capitalist production just because it is
hard to see what our commodity is or because we have more autonomy and
better benefits than
other members of the working class. Labour is not just a part of the
capitalist relationship, it is “the truly active side of capital, the
natural site of every capitalist dynamic” (Tronti). So we have to be vigilant
with respect to our complicity in the processes and dynamics of
capitalist social reproduction.</p>

<p>Eventually, of course, vigilance will not be enough; we will also have to see that
increasing our standard of living relative, or our autonomy, or our
benefits, with respect to others (especially students and marginalized
users) is not a goal worth pursuing. Eventually we too will be
completely proletarianized. In the words of Tronti, what needs to occur,
in libraries and universities as part of the social factory, is that
“labour must see labour-power, as <em>commodity</em>, as its own enemy” -
improving the “value” of our commodity, our labour-power, is not enough,
we have to end the fact of labour as a commodity completely, as part of
the total abolition of the commodity-form in general.</p>
