<p>In his book <em>Eurocentrism</em>, Samir Amin writes that modernity “is the
claim that human beings, individually and collectively, can and must
make their own history” (13). It is this claim that underpins a host of
thinkers mainly, but not exclusively, forming the hegemonic core of the
liberal tradition, such as Rousseau, Locke, and Kant. The values and
presuppositions of this tradition - an abstract and sacrosanct concept
of freedom, methodological individualism, white supremacy, patriarchy etc. - remains dominant within
Western society, and provides the core doctrines of mainstream
librarianship. Intellectual freedom - in the form which has vied with
“social responsibility” at least since the 1930s - is part of this
hegemonic liberal tradition deriving from the liberal thinkers of the
late-17th and 18th centuries. This liberal tradition, up to and
including the present moment, is the tradition of modernity (with
“postmoderity” considered not as a break, but simply as the latest
inflection of the modernist period). Liberal modernity is, of course,
the intellectual, cultural, and political project of the male, white,
bourgeoisie who used the intellectual tradition to buttress, support,
and extend their own political and economic power in the form of
capitalism.</p>

<p>Antonio Negri, however, traces a separate genealogy, one which begins
with Machiavelli, and can be traced through Spinoza and Marx, and which
constitutes an alternative “anti-modernity” in which the absolute
freedom of liberalism is exposed as a myth. Spinoza, for example, denies
both historical human-centred teleology and insists on a structural
determinism deriving from the identity of God with the natural world:
“men think themselves free”, he writes in the <em>Ethics</em>, “because they are conscious of
their volitions and their appetite, and do not think, even in their
dreams, of causes by which they are disposed to wanting and willing,
because they are ignorant of [those causes]” (26). The absolute freedom
and sovereignty of individual desire is an article of faith for
bourgeois liberalism (“the customer is always right”). For Spinoza,
however, such freedom is an illusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Men are deceived in that they think themselves free (i.e. they think
that, of their own free will, they can either do a thing or forbear
doing it), an opinion which consists only in this, that they are
conscious of their actions and ignorant of the causes by which they are
determined. This, then, is their idea of freedom - that they do not
know any cause of their actions. (53)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For Marx the atheist, of course, God is replaced by history as the
structuring and determining agent. In the <em>18th Brumaire of Louis
Bonaparte</em>, he writes that “men make their own history, but they do not
make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances
chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered,
given, and transmitted from the past” (15). The connection between
Spinoza and Marx in challenging the modern liberal idea that ‘men are
free to make their own history’ also includes, in Negri’s view,
Machiavelli, for whom the agency of <em>virtù</em> must contend with the
structure of <em>fortuna</em>. And it connects also with Nietzsche, to whom
Spinoza comes very close when he writes that “whatever conduces to
health and the worship of God, [men] have called <em>good</em>, but what is
contrary to these, <em>evil</em>” (Spinoza, <em>Ethics</em>, 29).</p>

<p>“Intellectual freedom”, then, is firmly embedded within
liberal-bourgeois modernity, and the various intellectual freedom
statements rest on the various liberal presumptions (absolute freedom,
individualism, etc.). What are the consequences for intellectual
freedom, then, if we take seriously the anti-modern genealogy,
especially the thought of Spinoza, whose determinism is probably the
strongest of all the anti-modern thinkers?</p>

<p>First, and this is a very common tenet within #critlib and social
justice movements more generally, we have to recognize the power of
structure. We are born into a society with a history that predates us,
into a culture that is always-already present to us, determining our
ideas and our relationships with other people and with power. I was born
into the “liberal democratic” constitutional monarchy currently known as
Canada - I was not free to do otherwise, nor am I free not to abide by
the laws and customs of the country, supported by the power of the state
and of social convention respectively, unless I am prepared to take the
consequences. I am not free <em>not</em> to sell my labour for a wage, although
I have not consented to this exploitative relationship. Such structures
are all around us, operating intersectionally to <em>overdetermine</em> the
development of what we tend to think of as “the individual”.</p>

<p>In addition to structure, we have to take power seriously. Power in
liberal thinking is defused by consent. The social contract renders - in
theory - all exercise of power consensual, no matter how cruel. For
Hobbes, whose liberal theory persists today in a dark flipside to the openly avowed
theory of Locke, every act by the sovereign power is “authored” by
subjects, to the extent that even an unjust execution of a subject by a
monarch cannot be considered an injury, because the subject is the
author of his own execution (here, Hobbes is the forefather of
victim-blaming). But in the anti-modern tradition, power is a vital
force which plays a huge role in society, ethics, and politics.
Machiavelli and Spinoza were derided as evil in the liberal-modern
tradition precisely for their avowal of the importance of power. Marx
and Engels’ “the history of all hitherto existing society is the history
of class struggle” is an open avowal of the role of power in class
society. Nietzsche’s <em>Will to Power</em> was twisted and distorted by his
sister to provide an intellectual justification for the Third Reich.
Liberalism sees power as an Other that must be excluded (repressed in
the Freudian sense), just as power’s
expression in violence must be either immediately neutralized (when it
belongs to marginalized populations), or radically performed (by the
police and the military) while at the same time euphemized out of polite
discourse (“a man died” somehow…). Indeed “neutrality”, in
librarianship and elsewhere, is meant as the
neutralization of power itself, a prospect which lies at the heart of
liberal modernity but is soundly rejected by the anti-modern
tradition. As Nietzsche once wrote, “My formula for happiness: a Yes, a
No, a straight line, a goal” - this is the complete opposite of a
purported neutrality.</p>

<p>The dominant idea of “intellectual freedom” refuses to take either
structure or power seriously. As the inheritor of the entire
liberal-modern tradition, it is incapable of dealing with structure as
the counterweight to absolute freedom, or commitment to a cause as a
counterweight to neutrality. As a result, intellectual freedom
becomes a tool to support the hegemony of liberal-modernity, bourgeois
culture, and the capitalist mode of production itself.</p>
