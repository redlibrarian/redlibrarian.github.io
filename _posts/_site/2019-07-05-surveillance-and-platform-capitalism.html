<p>Much of the analysis of platforms, data, and surveillance are predicated on a
methodological individualism which sees platform users as individuals carrying
out activities which merely happen to take place on digital platforms. In some
cases, these activities are simply pre-digital tasks carried over into the digital
realm, in other cases they constitute relations between users which are only
mediated by the platform. In this paper, I want to make two claims: first, that
such individualism obscures the aggregate nature not only of the user-base but
of the ways in which data is collected, analyzed, and employed for commercial 
or control purposes; and second, that the activities carried out on digital
platforms have been entirely restructured according to the logic of networked
machines themselves.</p>

<p>Two major interpretations of the social effects of new technologies are Nick
Srnicek’s “platform capitalism” and Shoshana Zuboff’s “surveillance capitalism”.
Srnicek and Zuboff each argue that what we are witnessing is a new phase of
capitalism defined, on the one hand by the prevalence of digital platforms, on the
other hand by the deployment of such platforms for surveillance purposes.
Srnicek claims that platform capitalism is “a new way of accumulating capital”
(Srnicek 2017, 36) predicated on a “massive new raw material to appropriate:
data” (88). However, while Srnicek rightly connects the novelty of platform
capitalism to long-term socio-economic trends and developments, Zuboff sees
“surveillance capitalism” not only as new, but as unprecedented. Surveillance
capitalism, she writes, is “a new actor in history, both original and sui generis. It
is of its own kind and unlike anything else.” (Zuboff 2018, 14).</p>

<p>Both Srnicek and Zuboff, however, agree that it is the individual which is the
target of both platform and surveillance capitalism. Srnicek sees platforms as
mediating between users, with user activity seen as independent of the platform
itself, self-directed non-technological acts engaged in by autonomous
individuals. Platforms, in this view, are situated between users who are carrying
out their own activities and are simply “the ground on which their activities
occur” (44). For example, Uber is a platform that connects drivers and riders, but
is not seen as structuring that relationship; Facebook is a platform that underpins
social interactions between users, but the social interactions are unchanged from
the pre-digital days. The ability to track, analyze, and monetize social
interactions becomes almost an afterthought. Similarly, Zuboff sees the
behaviour of users on social media platforms as independent of the ability to
track that usage. The advances in information technology that began in the 1990s
have led, in Zuboff’s view, to a situation “in which every casual search, like, and
click was claimed as an asset to be tracked, parsed, and monetized by some
company… eventually, companies began to explain these violations as the
necessary quid pro quo for ‘free’ internet services” (52). By characterizing
tracking of activity and exploitation of user-data as “violations” Zuboff posits
activities on social media platforms as independent and autonomous behaviour
which only becomes the target of capitalist exploitation after the fact. For Zuboff,
society is composed of sovereign individuals with rights who act autonomously -
sovereignty and rights which are challenged by a parasitic surveillance
capitalism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new harms we face entail challenges to the sanctity of the individual, and
chief among these challenges I count the elemental rights that bear on individual 
sovereignty, including the right to the future tense and the right to security. Each of
these rights invokes claims to individual agency and personal autonomy as
essential prerequisites to freedom of will and to the very concept of democratic
order. (54)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ontological claim that rights-holding individuals form the basis of society
has a long lineage in liberal political theory and classical political economy.
Indeed, Marx directly challenged the methodological individualism of Proudhon
in The Poverty of Philosophy 1847 (Marx 1963) and that of Smith and Ricardo in the
“Introduction” written ten years later (Marx 1973). Robert Urqhart explains the
persistence of methodological individualism by arguing that it supports the
capitalist economic regime: “The enactment of the idea of the atomic individual
facilitates the development of the economic order, and to a degree turns the
mistake into reality” (Urqhart 2013, 813). Marxist theory, on the other hand
prefers to rely on an ontology of “methodological collectivism” (Weldes 1989,
355) which, as we will see below, informs Antonio Negri’s conception of the
multitude, and offers a different perspective on platform and surveillance
capitalism.</p>

<p>In both Srnicek and Zuboff, the presumption of individualism allows them to
see a strict separation between the natural activity of individuals on the one hand
and the aims of platform and surveillance companies on the other. For Zuboff,
“individuals are definitively cast as the means to others’ market ends” while
“information and connection are ransomed for the lucrative behavioural data
that fund immense growth and profits” (54). This separation ignores both the
affective implications for users within digital networks and platforms, as well as
the importance of aggregate user groups in the formation of Big Data sets and
the mining of that data for surveillance, commercial, and control purposes.</p>

<p>While Srnicek admits that platforms are not merely “empty spaces for others
to interact on” but “in fact embody a politics” (47), he sees platforms as not
restructuring immaterial or unseen labour itself, but merely appropriating data
as a by-product of user-activity. For example, “rather than exploiting free
labour”, advertising platforms “appropriate data as a raw material” (56). While
recognizing that platforms are not neutral spaces, Srnicek still insists that
“platforms are digital infrastructures that enable two or more groups to interact”
(43). This understanding of platforms as enablers rather than structuring
processes in their own right comes from Srnicek’s conception of labour and value
in platform capitalism. Srnicek analyzes the various claims made regarding
online behaviour as “free labour”, but in the end denies that platform capitalism
profits off any kind of online labour, instead arguing that user data is a “raw
material” that is simply harvested by platform capital (53-56). For Srnicek, user 
actions still mainly occupy a space outside of platforms, thus supporting the idea
that platforms mediate already-existing behaviour but do not newly construct
user actions and behaviours. Once user activity takes place on a platform,
though, it is then ripe for harnessing by capital as value: “The activities of users
and institutions, if they are recorded and transformed into data, become a raw
material that can be refined and used in a variety of ways by platforms” (56).
What Srnicek ignores, however, is the covert, behind-the-scenes, “backdoor”
tracking of user activity analyzed by Zuboff. The platforms are ubiquitous and so
it is hard to argue, as Srnicek would like, that there is any activity within a digital
environment which is not structured by a platform and subject to surveillance.</p>

<p>The gradual restructuring of online activity from conscious online labour
(open-source software development is a good example) to mystified, aggregated,
“always-on” monitoring, analysis, and exploitation accords with the long term
processes of subsumption developed by Marx and which form a core component
of autonomist Marxist theories of capitalist development. Subsumption of labour
under capital sees some activities to be outside the scope of surplus-valueextraction until they are “brought into the fold” of the labour process. In this
sense, we can understand platform capitalism as a process of subsumption in
which previously non-digital, offline activities like searching for information,
booking a taxi, or interacting socially, were initially moved online without
changing their nature (formal subsumption) and then gradually deconstructed
and remade the more easily to exploit online labour and profit from its product
(data). From using a phone book, booking a taxi was then done on a firm’s
website or using a mobile app; the development of sophisticated ride-share
systems completely restructured the taxi business, making both driver and rider
users within an atomized networked social machine. Srnicek and Zuboff
continue to see the digital realm as only formally subsumed, as a consequence of
their methodological individualism and the separation between the individual
and the network that follows from it.</p>

<p>However, once we recognize platform capitalism as the result of real
subsumption, of the complete restructuring of online activity and its total
recuperation by the process of value-creation, then surveillance and data-mining
are no longer after-effects, but are the core business of the platforms themselves.
One consequence of this is that users must be understood not merely as engaging
in traditional, self-directed activities in a new place, but as completely integrated
within a social machine whose purpose is to extract aggregate surplus-value
from tiny isolated moments of labour which, under conditions of formal
subsumption, were not considered productive or profitable. What follows from
this is that it is not the individual actions which are of interest to contemporary
capitalism, but activity in the aggregate, the movement of the multitude through
the gates and circuits of digital capitalism.</p>
