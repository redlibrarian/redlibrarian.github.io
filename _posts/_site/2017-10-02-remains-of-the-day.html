<p>Kazuo Ishiguro, <em>The Remains of the Day</em>, Penguin Books, 1989.</p>

<p>I read <em>The Remains of the Day</em> over a long-weekend shortly after
Ishiguro won the Nobel Prize. I’ve been meaning to read Ishiguro for
years; my friend Kyle listed it as one of the <a href="http://stungeye.com/archive/by_date/2015/01/22">top three fiction books he
read in 2014</a>. In the
end I enjoyed it; it was nice to read a good, classically constructed
English novel, with nothing pomo or meta about it. But when it came to
writing a review of it for this blog, I’ve struggled with figuring out
what to say. I don’t think I found it as affecting as others have;
perhaps I just read it at the wrong moment. Anyway, an paragraph from an
email I sent to Kyle will have to suffice.</p>

  <p>I’ve been struggling to write a review of Remains of the Day for my
blog. I enjoyed it - I read it in a weekend - but I felt like it didn’t
quite add up to as much as I would have liked. I saw the movie not long
after it came out, so I remembered the climactic moment being really
emotional, but the ice only cracks for a second in the book. It’s well
done - maintaining the reserve for so long, the control in the style and
way of presenting Stevens’ views, and so the moment is pretty moving
when it comes, but I felt like it came and went and it was hard to know
what, if any, lasting consequences there were going to be. Or even if
there weren’t going to be any… Anyway, it was good; a colleague lent
me a copy of The Buried Giant, which she really liked, so I’ll give that
one a try.</p>
