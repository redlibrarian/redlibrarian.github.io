<p>Dostoyevsky, <em>The Brothers Karamazov</em>.</p>

<p>Since its inception, I have used this blog to think aloud and think
through particular questions around technology, politics, and ethics. I
have been pretty explicit about my own positions: the fundamentally
exploitative and alienating (and unfixable) relationships of capitalism,
the commitment to virtue ethics (as opposed to deontology or
consequentialism), and the idea that both our social/political problems
and their solutions are collective, not individual. But I haven’t spoken
at all about a long-standing position which informs a lot of my
politics: pacifism. In a sense, this is because pacifism is such a
deeply-rooted foundation of my ethics that I hardly ever think about it
explicitly, but also because pacifism raises issues (around the
dictatorship of the proletariat, for example, but also around the idea
of punching Nazis) that I haven’t particularly wanted to address. Last
Thursday marked the 75th anniversary of D-Day, and last week <em>also</em> saw
the release of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls
report, with its explicit judgement on Canadian history and society as
genocidal. Commentary on D-Day thus mingles with commentary on the
report and the various political contestations of the definition of
genocide, so I thought some thinking out loud about pacifism might be in
order.</p>

<p>There are various forms of pacifism, from so-called “contingent” or
“just-war pacifism” which supports war in particular limited
circumstances, through the anti-war pacifism which is not against
violence in other forms, to non- and anti-violence either towards humans
or towards all living creatures. I fall somewhere in the antiviolence
towards humans category (I’m not vegan or vegetarian, and this raises
its own ethical questions and problems). My pacifism stems, probably,
from disgust at schoolyard and neighbourhood violence, and an anti-war
stance was simply an extension of this; some pacifists, I imagine,
start out holding anti-war positions and then either extend their
pacifism to the more personal level, or not. But for me, pacifism
begins with a hatred of individualized violence, a victim confronted
with an attacker or a mob, and the anti-war position is simply an
extension of that.</p>

<p>I’m making this point explicitly, because for me, the following position
is incoherent:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/gibson.png" /></p>

<p>“Increasing glorification of war” means that a certain amount of
glorification of war is acceptable, that there is such a thing as just
and honourable war, and that it is only when a certain tipping point is
reached that war (or its glorification at any rate) becomes a problem.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/gibson2.png" /></p>

<p>The belief in a just and honourable war that <em>becomes</em> overly
politicized or corrupted is a myth, just as the idea of a democratic
Canada that <em>became</em> totalitarian is a myth. Capitalist, colonialist
nations are never democratic, just as war - the slaughter of millions of
human beings for the most tawdry of political reasons - is never just.
“Just war” and “democratic state” are comforting lies we tell ourselves
to hide our murderous, genocidal past from ourselves.</p>

<p>My great-grandfather, Ithel Davies, was a conscientious objector in the
First World War, imprisoned in a military prison until he was beaten so
badly that a question was raised in parliament and eventually COs were
transferred to civilian jails. There is an unbroken line that connects
the individualized violence of the imperialist state war machine and the
one-on-one violence of “barracks justice”, just as there is an unbroken
line that connects the individualized crimes of, say, Robert Picton, and
the capitalist, colonialist Canadian state. A hatred of war and a hatred
of crime go hand in hand, because war (even a one-sided war against
powerless opposition, which is genocide) is the greatest crime.</p>

<p>Now, such pacifism raises direct political questions, especially for a
Marxist. What do you with the capitalists? How do you “expropriate the
expropriators” without violence? What is the dictatorship of the
proletariat but the oppression/repression of the current ruling class in
the name of a future justice. Is the dictatorship of the proletariat
simply the “just war” myth of historical materialism?</p>

<p>I’m currently rereading <em>Crime and Punishment</em> which is directly
concerned with these questions (since the question of the justification
of revolutionary violence predates the Bolsheviks, and was a “cursed
question” in the 1860s). Raskolnikov’s initial justification for the
murder of the pawnbroker and her sister is “the greatest happiness of
the greatest number”, that is a utilitarian rationality that has been
used to justify enormous acts of violence, including those associated
with the Bolshevik revolution, but also the colonial violence of the
Canadian genocide (“kill the Indian in the child”), the Vietnam war (“we
had to destroy the village in order to save it”), and the ongoing crimes
and betrayals of the labour-capital relation the world over. This is the
same kind of consequentialism that infects individual ethics: the end
justifies the means. Dostoyevsky would rail against this idea in all of
his greatest novels, but nowhere more strikingly than in Ivan
Karamazov’s statement that if the cost of righteousness and a glorious
future was the suffering of a single child, then he rejected such a
future outright.</p>

<p>All this raises huge questions for me of political action, and the
limits of political action, but I think that replacing a utilitarian
consequentialism with deontological set of rules (such as, for example,
United Nations conventions on warfare) simply evades the issue. The UN
more or less legally enshrines the idea of a just war, an idea which I
reject. And where is the UN on, for example, the Canadian genocide? The
Canadian government ignores UN declarations with impunity.</p>

<p>I think Ivan Karamazov comes down on the side of a virtue ethics: what
kind of human being do I want to be, and Dostoyevsky - albeit in a
nationalist/conservative fashion - extends that to the
religiously-constituted society. What constitutes the good society - not
in the future, but now? This raises, as it should, a whole host of
political questions around collective action, collective responsibility,
collective power, and self-determination, but these are not questions
that should be avoided. Myths such as the just war or capitalist
democracy allow us to avoid those questions, but at the cost of handing
over the ethical and political orientation of society to murderers,
criminals, generals, and those who commit genocide.</p>

<p>I haven’t spoken here about wars of national liberation, guerilla wars
against invaders, or whether there is any longer a useful distinction
between physical and non-physical violence. Baharak Yousefi’s discussion
of trauma in her closing keynote at the CAPAL conference last week
raised the idea of widening and broadening the idea of trauma just as,
perhaps, we need to widen and broaden the idea of genocide. These are
all questions I have no answers to, but they are important questions to
consider, and not only for pacifists.</p>
