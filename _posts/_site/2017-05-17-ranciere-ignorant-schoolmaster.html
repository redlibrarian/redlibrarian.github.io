<p>Jacques Rancière, <em>The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in
Intellectual Emancipation</em>, Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991.</p>

<p>There are books that you read at exactly the right time. I have been
struggling with a long time with the feeling that libraries are without
a mission, without a solid, concrete purpose. All our discussions around
what to call our users/patrons/customers suggest it; the silos that
exist in any library of a certain size, to my mind, prove it. I don’t
think that librarians or staff working in cataloguing, acquisitions,
systems, public services, information literacy, etc, etc, have a set of
goals that cross all those areas. Part of this is due to the privileging
of technical knowledge in librarianship - some of this is rigorous in
some units (like metadata and cataloguing), very weak in others (like
public services), and in still others is rigorous but (if done right)
not library-specific (like library systems units). The values and
mission statements of libraries, which are primarily brand- and
optics-related, only make the problem worse: the lack of actual values
and missions is obscured by the fact that we have value and mission
statements on our websites.</p>

<p>So, for what feels like a long time, I’ve been wondering about a
possible unifying mission for libraries. What kind of thing would that
look like. Many of the possibilities are predicated, unfortunately, on a
liberal ideology that, to my mind, is in the process of collapse after a
hegemony of two or three centuries. Individualism, pluralism, and
self-improvement tend to be the values underpinning our mission
statements (though, true to any hegemonic ideology, these are unstated
and unconscious); these unspoken values lie at the heart of
librarianships perennial argument over “neutrality”. Would it be
possible to come up with a mission (if only provisionally) that was not
based on these unspoken and unquestioned values?</p>

<p>Rancière, in a way, is attacking liberalism in another area, that
of education. <em>The Ignorant Schoolmaster</em> is a meditation on the radical
educational strategies of Jacques Jacotot, a teacher and politician who,
after the restoration of the French monarchy in 1815, went to Belgium
and established a school. He spoke no Flemish, and his students no
French, but Jacotot was able to develop a pedagogy by which <em>a pupil
could be taught something the teacher does not know</em>. Rancieère
argues that Jacotot’s method departs from the traditional view of
education, which is <em>explication</em>: a teacher explains things to student
with an aim to bringing their level of knowledge up to the teacher’s
own. For Rancieère, this model of teaching requires that the
intelligence of the student to be subjected to the will of the teacher.
A condition in which the intelligence of one is dominated by the will of
another is a condition of subjection, and in the intellectual field,
Jacotot and Rancière refer to this as “stultification”
(<em>abrutissement</em>). What Jacotot’s educational method aims for is not
instruction, but emancipation; the condition of “an intelligence in the
service of a will”. The traditional pedagogy, too, is predicated on an
inequality of intelligence (teachers know more than students, the middle
classes know more than peasants), whil Jacotot’s method is based on a
fundamental commitment to the “equality of intelligence”.</p>

<p>Now, Rancière’s description of the world of the “Old
[School]Master”, the system of explication and instruction that result
in stultification and self-contempt based on the belief instilled in
students that they are stupid, fits to a t my own experience of
education, at least in primary, secondry, and undergraduate level.
The role of professors, for example, in my undergrad, was pretty clearly
not to lead students towards any kind of intellectual emancipation, but
was to impart a few facts (enough to pass a course), and induct students
into the socio-political order (that is, an order of subjection and
exploitation), and when challenged, generally responded in a way
calculated to put the student in their (intellectual) place.</p>

<p>My education primarily took place within the library. Rancière
describes the role of <em>the book</em> in Jacotot’s educational method:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By leaving his intelligence out of the picture, he had allowed
their intelligence to grapple with that of the book. Thus,
the two functions that link the practice of the master explicator,
that of the savant and that of the master had been dissociated.
The two faculties in play during the act of learning, namely
intelligence and will, had therefore also been separated, liberated
from each other. A pure relationship of will to will had
been established between master and student: a relationship
wherein the master’s domination resulted in an entirely liberated
relationship between the intelligence of the student and
that of the book— the intelligence of the book that was also the
thing in common, the egalitarian intellectual link between
master and student. This device allowed the jumbled categories
of the pedagogical act to be sorted out, and explicative stultification
to be precisely defined. There is stultification whenever
one intelligence is subordinated to another. A person— and a
child in particular— may need a master when his own will is
not strong enough to set him on track and keep him there. But
that subjection is purely one of will over will. It becomes
stultification
when it links an intelligence to another intelligence.
In the act of teaching and learning there are two wills and two
intelligences. We will call their coincidence stultification. In the
experimental situation Jacotot created, the student was linked
to a will, Jacotot’s, and to an intelligence, the book’s— the two
entirely distinct. We will call the known and maintained difference
of the two relations— the act of an intelligence obeying
only itself even while the will obeys another will—emancipation. (p. 13)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, my question became: what if the library recognized and took
ownership of its etymological history as <em>a place of books</em>? What if it
began to take seriously a mission not of “access to information” or
“access to material”, but of emancipation. What if instead of
information literarcy, we thought about intellectual emancipation?
Instead of the multiple goals of cataloguing, systems, or public
services, we engaged seriously with a mission of emancipation? In an
academic context, we could provide a counterweight to the traditional
(explicatory) model of pedagogy dominant in the academy; in the public
context, we could provide a liberation from the cultural dominance of
neoliberal capitalism and its requirements for consumption. The value of
libraries, to my mind, a motto we would do well to take really
seriously, is how Rancière sums up the place of the book in this
radical, emancipatory project: “The book <em>is</em> the equality of
intelligence” (38).</p>
