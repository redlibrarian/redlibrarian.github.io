<p>In discussing classical liberalism, the Oxford University Press <a href="http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780199021734.html"><em>Introduction to
Politics</em></a> (Second
Canadian Edition) writes that “the liberal critique of fascism as
ideologies is a reflection of a tendency among some liberals to regard
liberalism as somehow above the ideological fray” and quotes Barbara
Goodwin’s <em>Using Political Ideas</em>. The full quotation from Goodwin runs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Britain we imbibe liberal ideas effortlessly from an early age, with
the result that liberalism appears as a necessary truth, the basis of
reality, rather than as one political ideology among many. (35).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In thinking about this question of “neutrality” that plagues
librarianship (and many other “liberal professions”), it occurred to me
that the concept of neutrality could only apply to a phenomenon that is
(or thinks it is) “above the fray”. The State, for example, in liberal
terms, is seen as neutral, as moderating between a plurality of views,
standing above competing classes, rather than maintaining (through
force) the hegemony of the ruling class (see, for example, Lenin’s
discussion of the state at the beginning of <em>The State and Revolution</em>). 
In terms of ideologies, “neutrality” can only belong to something that sees itself as non-ideological. The argument is circular: liberalism is neutral because it is not an ideology, and it is not an ideology because it is neutral. The pluralism of views that liberalism maintains is seen as proving its non-ideological nature.</p>

<p>David Harvey, in his first important work of theory, introduces two
definitions of “ideology”, one Marxist, the other liberal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marx gives a specific meaning to ideology - he regards it as an
<em>unaware</em> expression of the underlying ideas and beliefs which attach
to a particular social situation, in contrast to the <em>aware</em> and
critical exposition of ideas in their social context which is
frequently called ideology in the west. (<em>Social Justice and the City</em>,
18).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This fits with Goodwin’s characterization of liberalism appearing as a
“necessary truth”, something of which we might not even be conscious.
Perversely, for liberalism, it is precisely the unconscious nature of
its values and priorities that, in contrast to the all-too-conscious
ideologies of both right and left, make liberalism central, neutral,
equivocal, moderating. It seems to me that the question of library
neutrality comes down to this unconscious presumption of liberal values.</p>

<p>The problem with liberalism - as we are currently seeing - is that by
being unaware or unconscious, it prevents questions being asked about
it, it suppresses alternative voices, words, and ideas, precisely
because those voices have nothing to speak against: liberalism is silent
in its automatic presumption of the truth of the world. Not the least
debt we owe to Marx is that he made the ideology of liberalism explicit,
allowing all those who came after to challenge and question, to
interrogate and cross-examine the presumptions of liberalism, including
the presumption of neutrality.</p>

<p>In my recent posts on Franklin’s <a href="https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2017/05/14/franklin-real-world-of-technology.html"><em>The Real World of
Technology</em></a>
and Pateman &amp; Pateman’s <a href="https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2017/05/23/patemans-cultural-change.html">“Managing Cultural Change in Public
Libraries”</a>
I challenged, on the one hand, the unaware ideology of Ursula Franklin and the
aware but mistaken ideology of John Pateman.</p>

<p>Franklin epitomizes the unconscious, unaware ideology of Canadian liberalism. For
her, the liberal values of individualism, reason, private-property, and
self-improvement are so self-evident that she never needs to enunciate
them - she can simply presume that her audience shares them. In Canada,
where the Liberal Party has been called “Canada’s natural governing
party”, perhaps this was a valid assumption, especially at Massey Hall
to an audience of <em>Ideas</em> listeners in 1987. Franklin is very good at
describing the pernicious effects of technology on society, but her
liberalism prevents her from explaining <em>why</em> such effects take place,
which make it impossible for her to explain how we might go about
changing things. For Franklin, the social contract (another liberal
idea) has become worn down through the effects of technology and must be
renewed. For her, we must simply <em>decide</em> to do better, and we can
change our world. The problems of “the real world of technology” are
simply due to mistakes; if we make the right decisions now, all will be
well again. There is no room in her analysis for anything beyond the
liberal constellation of individual-social contract-private
property. She admits to no domination, no exploitation, no
rapaciousness, and she certainly would not admit that, for example,
capitalists and workers might not share a set of values.</p>

<p>For Pateman, the problem is a little different. He believes he is a
Marxist, and he is conscious of this ideology. However, he is unable to
really connect the Marxist theory he espouses with the material
existence of the organizations he is trying to critique. His models
aren’t founded in anything real, so his proposals for libraries are
utopian more than anything else. He states things about libraries (both
traditional and progressive) as if they are facts; whether they are or
not is immaterial - they are not useful to actually existing libraries.
This is mainly because for Pateman, as for Franklin, everything comes
down to the rational decisions of a group of individuals with power*. For
Pateman, the structure of the “needs-based” library involves a “reforging
of the social contract” just as much as for Franklin. The problem with
traditional libraries doesn’t lie in the commodity form, exploitation,
structures of domination, or systems of inequality - it’s just a
mistake. Neoliberalism is a mistake, easily corrected as long as we
resubscribe to liberal values. Pateman can dress his (utopian) proposals
for libraries up in Marxist terms, but in the end he thinks that a
rational reforging of the social contract will solve our problems. In
the meantime, capitalism will get on with the job of exploiting people
and destroying the planet.</p>

<p>Because what “reforging the social contract” means is neutrality - it
means respecting pluralist views (which ensures that nothing gets
accomplished), it ensures the rule of law that protects that pluralism
(ensuring that nothing gets challenged) and it ensures the protection of
private property, as the institution that guarantees the
self-improvement of the individual by means of the free market. This is
the “neutrality” of liberalism, that is, no neutrality at all.
Neutrality doesn’t exist, it is a fiction invented by the liberal
ideology with an end to hiding the ideological nature of liberalism
itself.</p>

<p>* It’s ironic that, while Franklin denies
being a technological determinist, she really is, and Pateman claims to be a
determinist when he is not!</p>
