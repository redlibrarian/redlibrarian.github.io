<p>V.I. Lenin, <em>‘Left-Wing’ Communism, an infantile disorder</em> (Moscow:
Novosti Press Agency, 1970). <em>Originally published in 1920</em>.</p>

<p>In his “Study on the Unity of [Lenin’s] Thought” of 1924, Georg Lukacs
argued that the “core of Lenin’s thought” was the <em>actuality of the
proletarian revolution</em>. When I first read this, I was unclear as to
what that actually meant, but having finally read Lenin’s contribution
to international communist polemics, I think I finally get it. Not only
that, but I think it provides a thread of continuity throughout Lenin’s career
(e.g. in <em>What is to be Done</em> (1902) and <em>The State and Revolution</em>
(1917)); when you understand what Lukacs means by “the actuality of the
revolution”, a lot of Lenin’s theory and practice falls into place.</p>

<p><em>‘Left Wing’ Communism</em> is, ostensibly, an attempt by Lenin to identify
and describe the lessons of the Russian revolution that are applicable
to other countries in the context of 1920. This context includes the
rise of fascism and the communist response to that threat, controlled
primarily through the Comintern, but it also includes the activities and
programmes of communists and socialists in all the countries of Europe,
pricely because Lenin felt that proletarian revolution was not only on
the agenda in those countries, but because the revolution had, in
reality, already begun. We know now, with historical hindsight, that
Lenin was wrong about this, but it seems clear that this was not
propaganda, that Lenin really believed the revolution to be imminent,
and that he was making a good-faith contribution to the success of the
international revolution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lenin always saw the problems of his age as a whole: the onset of the
last phase of capitalism and the possibilities of turning the now
inevitable final struggle between bourgeois and proletariat in favor
of the proletariat - of human salvation. (Lukacs, Lenin, p. 11).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you read Lenin’s work as active interventions in what he saw as an
ongoing process of revolutionary organization and activity, it makes it
easier to understand the process of his thought, including the typical
criticisms of vacillation or opportunism, usually leveled against him.
As he states with his usual force in <em>‘Left Wing’ Communism</em>, there’s no
point in coming up with rigid, abstract rules of political activity;
politics and history are too complicated for that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To reject compromises ‘on principle’, to reject the permissibility of
compromises in general, no matter of what kind, is childishness, which
it is difficult even to consider seriously. A political leader who
desires to be useful to the revolutionary proletariat must be able to
distinghuish <em>concrete</em> cases of compromises that are inexcusable and
are an expression of opportunism and <em>treachery</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lenin is arguing against the “left wing” segments of various Communist
Parties who argue that their parties should not participate in bourgeois
parliaments (i.e. stand for election, seek seats) or work within
reactionary bourgeois trade unions. For Lenin, Communist Parties “must absolutely <em>work wherever the masses are to be found</em>”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To refuse to work in the reactionary trade unions means leaving the
insufficiently developed or backward masses of workers under the
influence of the reactionary leaders, the agents of the bourgeoisie,
the labour aristocrats, or ‘workers who have become completely
bourgeois’. (p. 45)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to me that Lenin’s view of parliaments is - similar to Marx’s -
based on their relative novelty and the fact that, in their respective
countries at their respective times, the bourgeoisie had not yet learned
to make parliaments tools of class oppression, totally dominated both
legally and ideologically by capital. In <em>The State and Revolution</em>,
Lenin calls the state a special institution for the suppression of one
class by another. But it seems clear that he distinguishes parliaments
from the state, just as he distinguishes political parties from
parliaments. These distinctions were, I assume, valid ones in Europe of
the 1850s (Marx) and Russia of 1905-1920, but to my mind, these
distinctions have - over the course of the twentieth century and into
the twenty-first - ceased to have any validity. The compromises - both
financial and ideological - required for any party to stand for
parliament in North America are such as to obliterate any left wing
progressivism (as witness the sorry state of today’s NDP); and
parliament has become an institution of ideological oppression (one of
Althusser’s Ideological State Apparatuses), while the non-parliamentary
state (what we call “the government”) handles actual physical oppression
and coercion. As someone who believes that any left-wing political party
worth the name should have nothing to do with bourgeois parliaments, I’m
one of those with an “infantile disorder”, like chicken pox, that Lenin
attacks in his pamphlet. Chicken pox isn’t particularly dangerous, and
is something we all have to go through; Lenin believes the left-wing
opposition will grow out of it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, North America in the
21st century is very different from Russia and Europe 100 years ago. Our
political parties <em>are not whether the masses can be found</em>, as lower
and lower voter turnout and party memberships show. It is a waste of
time to participate in any of the bourgeois parties, just as it is a
waste of time to vote for them; indeed, voting simply lends a veneer of
legitimacy to an institution of oppression and propaganda. I’m
suspicious too of movementism (like Naomi Klein’s Leap Manifesto
movement), and the only party which seems to have anything radical to
say is the Maoist Revolutionary Communist Party (<a href="http://www.pcr-rcp.ca/">PCR-RCP</a>). <em>But</em>, this has a lot to do with the fact that we are <em>not</em> experiencing “the actuality of the revolution”. If anything, our situation is closer to the Russia of Lenin’s youth, when useful political activity was only possible within the study circles such as the one Dostoyevsky belonged to, and for which he was exiled to Siberia. This “circle organization” (<em>kruzhkovshchina</em>) was occupied primarily with education and propaganda, of trying to expose the barbarity of capitalism and the bourgeois state (the kinds of things we now tend to call social justice). Propaganda and education existed alongside economic activism (i.e. labour union activity). Eventually, political activity matured leading to more rigorous activism (“agitation”) and eventually poltical organizing with a view to fomenting revolution. We can’t see that far ahead, obviously, but our propaganda, our education, must reflect the potential for another period - hopefully coming sooner rather than later - of “the actuality of the revolution”.</p>

<hr />

<p>2017 is obviously a great time to be reading Lenin and other theorists
of the Russian Revolution to see what remains valid for us of their
experience. Lenin’s works are short, but - because they were written for
immediate political purposes - they can be a bit dense and impenetrable,
full of forgotten names and superseded polemics. But there is a wealth
to be found there - and in Trotsky too - that ought to ring true to
anyone working on the left in Canada, 100 years after the overthrow of
the bourgeois state in Russia. What happened in Russia after the death
of Lenin is an argument not worth getting into here, but it should not
detract from the historical and political value of the popular rising
that put the Bolsheviks in power.</p>
