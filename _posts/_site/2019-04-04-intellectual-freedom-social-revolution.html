<p>Lars T. Lih, <em>Lenin Rediscovered: What is to be Done in Context</em>.</p>

<p>In Lars Lih’s monumental book, he  tries to place Lenin and Lenin’s 1902
pamphlet <em>What is to be Done</em> in their concrete historical context. Lih
argues that prior to World War 1, Lenin was a committed “Erfurtian”,
that is, he subscribed to the programme and ideals of the German Social
Democratic Party as formalized by Kautsky and others. For Lenin, Lih
writes, “political freedom” comprised four elements: freedom of speech,
association, assembly, and strikes. In today’s conjuncture, as “freedom
of speech” has become a cultural battleground, I think it’s useful to
ask in what way the context of “freedom of speech” (and intellectual freedom more
broadly) has changed since the Europe of the late nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The “weaponization” of freedom of speech/freedom of expression as, for
example, found in Peter MacKinnon’s recent book <em>University Commons
Divided: Exploring Debate &amp; Dissent on Campus</em>.(for which I have a
review forthcoming in <a href="https://cjal.ca/index.php/capal/index">CJAL</a>), tends to position “freedom of speech” as a
liberal bastion against the intolerant hordes of right and left who seek
to “censor” debate and the free flow of information in the marketplace
of ideas. For Lenin - and for the German Social Democrats - freedom of
speech meant <em>quite literally</em> freedom from <em>government</em> censorship.
This is still the interpretation used by free speech maximalists - that,
for example, the First Amendment protects against government censorship,
but not against non-government actors - indeed, this argument was used
as justification for the change to the ALA room booking
interpretation of 2018 to explicitly allow hate groups into public
library spaces. It was argued that <em>as government agencies</em>
public libraries had to be clear in their non-contravention of the First
Amendment.</p>

<p>So, the main framing of freedom of speech is as a protection against the
power of the state, which is fair enough; but this framing is then
simply widened to include non-state groups who seek to “silence” (really
deplatform) speakers and stifle debate. What underpins the fear of
limiting free expression in non-state contexts is, I believe, a
residual fear of state oppression that is a holdover from a previous
political conjuncture. The “political revolution” awaited by the German
and Russian Social Democrats was a bourgeois (that is, a liberal)
revolution; “freedom of speech” was part of the bourgeois political
programme, seeking to liberate expression from the limits placed on it by
government censorship. Those who cling to an outdated free-speech
maximalism are still under the sway of a pre-revolutionary ideology
(classical liberalism).</p>

<p>But we are beyond the bourgeois/liberal revolution. In Europe, in
Canada, in the United States, the bourgeoisie overthrew the aristocracy
and the nobility hundreds of years ago. The French and American
Revolutions are the two most exemplary (or “world historical”) of
bourgeois revolutions, but freedom of speech from government
interference is enshrined in all the liberal democracies on the planet.</p>

<p>I have written elsewhere how the fact that bourgeois liberalism
originated as the ideology of a particular identity - white, male,
middle-class, property-owning - means that positions from <em>outside</em> this
identity are simply incoherent to liberals (who therefore rely on a vague notion of ‘tolerance’ rather than a real understanding of difference). Bourgeois liberals today cannot
understand that the classical liberalism of two hundred years ago is no
longer adequate to a world in which the non-white, non-male,
non-property-owning, and non-middle-class are fighting back. The
resurgence of fascism and other right-wing ideologies, the unwillingness
of marginalized populations to “know their place” all challenge the
classical liberal orthodoxy, including the dominant framing of “freedom
of speech”, though because they share many other values (especially a
distrust of difference), liberals are
often able to find common ground with the right-wing in many other areas. In a post-political-revolution world “freedom of speech”,
indeed any pre-revolutionary liberal value, can no longer be
uncritically maintained except by those who have a conscious or
unconscious interest in maintaining the status quo: erasure of
difference, protection of private property, exploitation and
dehumanization of the
subaltern.</p>

<p>In LIS, “intellectual freedom” is often contrasted with “social
responsibility”, often with IF as a hegemonic norm and social
responsibility as a recurring complement to it. Liberal pluralism sees
social responsibility as simply another perspective, and the debates
between the two positions as - eventually - reconcilable without any
compromising of liberal values. But looked at from the perspective of
the distinction between the political and social revolutions, we can
understand the relation between IF and SR as a dialectical one: IF as the
present and positive value of the bourgeois revolution, SR as the
stirrings of and groping towards the social revolution to come. As in
all dialectical relationships, there can be no “reconciliation” of the
contradiction between these two positions, only the genesis of a third
term, which we might usefully think of as intellectual freedom beyond
the social revolution, an intellectual freedom which combines elements
of IF and SR but is not beholden to the interests of private capital and
the dominance of the white heteropatriarchal bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>What we need to think of now is a definition of freedom of
speech/freedom of expression/intellectual freedom proper to a
conjuncture looking forward to the next revolution, the social
revolution, in which the enemy is not (or not merely) the state, but all
the social forces of reaction, chauvinism, patriarchy, and
white-supremacy that hide behind the state. Intellectual freedom has to
give way to a politically sophisticated, committed <a href="https://redlibrarian.github.io/article/2018/09/11/intellectual-freedom-value-ethics.html">“intellectual
politics”</a>.
Freedom, in the period between the political revolution and the social
revolution, can no longer mean simply political freedom, though it must
subsume political freedom; it must be a social freedom appropriate to
the social revolution. It cannot be framed within an outmoded ideology
that serves only to protect bourgeois interests, but rather within a new
ideology that serves the interests of marginalized, oppressed,
exploited, and impoverished communities.</p>

<p>Liberal “intellectual freedom” is a value of those who would rather
cling to the hope of gradual change, which amounts to little more than
maintaining the status quo, than the social revolution. In 1911, Lenin
addressed <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1911/sep/14.htm">reformism in Russian
social-democracy</a>, and noted that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the more unadulterated the rule of the bourgeoisie, and the greater the political liberty, the more extensive is the application of the “most up-to-date” bourgeois slogan: reform versus revolution, the partial patching up of the doomed regime with the object of dividing and weakening the working class, and of maintaining the rule of the bourgeoisie, versus the revolutionary overthrow of that rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We live in a time of unparalleled political liberty (generally
speaking). It is all the more important, then, that we reject the idea
of reformism and the kind of partial, class-based intellectual freedom that attends it,
and look forward instead to a new universal intellectual freedom appropriate to a new
society.</p>
