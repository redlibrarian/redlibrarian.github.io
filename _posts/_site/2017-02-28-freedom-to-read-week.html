News</a></p>

<p>The last few years have seen the rise of a critical trend in
librarianship towards “Freedom to Read Week”, a period when libraries
typically draw attention to the everpresent threat of censorship. While
an anti-censorship stance is laudable and has, generally, been part of
libraries’ professed values for a long time (but not foreve), criticism
has generally taken two approaches. One the one hand, saying that people
should be able to read what they like is simplistic, ignores questions
of power and inequality and is, quite literally, <a href="https://twitter.com/lis_grievances/status/836289807001260033">the least we can
do</a>. On
the other hand, focusing on challenges to print materials (often limited
to <em>recreational</em> print material) ignores other challenges to
intellectual freedom and privacy that are arguably more important, and
which libraries would do well to turn their attention to. In a series of
tweets, Alan Harnum outlined the main points of this critique:</p>

<p>Another aspect of criticism arises in the context of academic libraries,
where “freedom to read” is bound up with different questions than in a
public library, or recreational-reading, context; questions of
intellectual honesty, critical thinking, evaluation of sources, and of
course, censorship and intellectual freedom. When my own library system
tweeted a “challenges book display” which included only fiction, it led
me to wonder about the broader question of “freedom to read” in an
academic environment.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s Freedom to Read week, which challenged books have you

<p>I find it interesting that, in an academic environment, the challenged
book display would include not only exclusively fiction titles, but
primarily Children’s/Young Adult titles. This is not due to any
devaluation of children’s or YA reading, simply the fact that using
these as examples of challenged titles is <em>too easy</em>. No-one but a
crypto-fascist arch-conservative would advocate suppression of <em>Where
The Wild Things Are</em> (and yes, I’m aware that this happens: there are a
lot of crypto-fascist arch-conservatives out there). <em>Anyone</em> in a
university ought to be able to successfully defend children’s and YA
books against a challenge. In addition, fiction titles are generally
covered by public library Freedom to Read Week approaches. It seems to
me that a more productive, more fruitful, approach to Freedom to Read
ideas in an academic environment would, at the very least, address the
exponentially more complicated question of Freedom to Read in a
scholarly context.</p>

<p>Because, while there can be no intellectually honest defense of a
challenge of <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> or - the example we used when I
was in library school - <em>In the Night Kitchen</em>, are there legitimate
reasons to imagine challenging <em>Mein Kampf</em> (tangent: someone on twitter
recently went on a tirade which was very interesting, but which was
predicated on the idea that the publication of <em>Mein Kampf</em> is banned in
Canada, which of course it is not). The university itself is committed
to intellectual freedom in the question of books it sells in the
bookstore (my bookstore copy of the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> proved extremely
important to me)  and collects in the library, indeed this is enshrined in the
academic freedom clause of many librarians. But in terms of reading,
advocating the reading of <em>Mein Kampf</em> is something very different from
advocating its collection, and this is something that that not many
students will get to consider if we restrict Freedom to Read Week
display to children’s/YA fiction, all of which can be considered
<em>innocent</em> in a way <em>Mein Kampf</em> is not. Freedom to Read Week displays
in an academic environment could be a teaching opportunity, but also a
lesson in responsibility. With recreational reading, Freedom to Read is
being free from someone else preventing you from reading. In an
academic environment, I would argue, we should be promoting the
<em>responsibility to read</em>, in the face of challenges both external and
internal.</p>

<p>And in a way, <em>Mein Kampf</em> is as simple an example as <em>Where the Wild
Things Are</em>. It is impossible not to have an opinion on <em>Mein Kampf</em>
whether or not one has read it. But let’s imagine including, among the
easier things to support, say <em>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</em>,
Machiavelli’s <em>Prince</em>, and <em>The Joy of Sex</em> (all <a href="http://lincolnlibraries.org/bookguide/booklists/banned-or-challenged-non-fiction/">challenged books at
one time/place or
another</a>, all of which would - nowadays would be considered at worst anodyne and at best fundamentally important to modern citizenship and social justice Now, what if we added to this collection, say, a book by (David
Irving)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving] whose work has been
condemned as holocaust-denial, but who nevertheless had a long career as
a respected historian. The fact that his work is challenged by “our
side” and on solid historigraphical and scholarly grounds disturbs the
simplistic view of intellectual freedom we (librarians) espouse. But
it’s an important perturbation, one to be engaged with, not ignored. Evaluating Irving’s work with intellectual
honesty and rigour <em>requires</em> reading it, whether or not we want to read
it or want others to read it. Including Irving in a display of Freedom
to Read Week books would be a useful, necessary, challenge not only to
students, but to the librarians themselves. It mustn’t be forgotten,
after all, that “challenge”, especially during Freedom to Read Week, has
positive as well as negative connotations.</p>
