<p><em>NOTE: This post contains some details about a recent episode of The
Good Place that could be construed as a spoiler.</em></p>

<p>In season three, episode four of <em>The Good Place</em>, Simone tries to help
Eleanor understand what’s wrong with her by explaining that she never
really got past the “me vs. us” problem (“The other possible medical
diagnosis is that you’re just a bit of a dick.”) Simone explains the “me
vs. us” problem as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As humans evolved the first big problem we had to overcome was me vs. us - learning to sacrifice a little individual freedom for the benefit of a group. Like sharing food and resources so we don’t starve or get eaten by tigers - things like that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This nicely illustrates the liberal assumption about how human society
formed, i.e. by <em>individuals</em> coming together for their own mutual
benefit. This assumption is known as “methodological individualism”, the
idea that, as Margaret Thatcher put it, “there’s no such thing as
society, there are individual men and women”. Methodological
individualism is an assumption in that it’s a starting point that is not
based on empirical experience, but on a particular theory of what
constitutes society (social ontology) that is pre-empirical. Unless
you’re a dyed-in-the-wool pure empiricist, this isn’t really a problem,
as long as the assumptions of social ontology are recognized as exactly
that: assumptions.</p>

<p>The social ontology by which individuals come together to form society
is a hallmark of liberalism. Not only did the classical liberal
political economists like Adam Smith subscribe to it (with his view of
human nature as a propensity for individuals to “truck, barter, and
exchange”), but even socialists like Proudhon subscribed to it. In his
1847 response to Proudhon’s <em>Philosophy of Poverty</em>, Marx argued that
Proudhon’s assumption that individual producers freely come together to
exchange the products of their labour was incorrect. Proudhon writes
that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since a very large number of things I need occur in nature only in
moderate quantities, or even not at all, I am forced to assist in the
production of what I lack. And as I cannot set my hand to so many
things, I shall <strong>propose</strong> to other men, my collaborators
in various functions, to cede to me a part of their products in
<strong>exchange</strong> for mine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a statement that places the origin of an exchange economy
precisely in the “me vs. us” context of <em>The Good Place</em>. At this point, Marx
criticized Proudhon’s view from the perspective of class struggle.
Rather than individuals, coming together for mutual benefit, Marx
writes, “the very moment civilisation begins, production begins to be
founded on the antagonism of orders, estates, classes, and finally on
the antagonism of accumulated labour and actual labour. No antagonism,
no progress.” (Marx, <strong>The Poverty of Philosophy</strong>, 53).
Rather than an individualist assumption, Marx is making a collectivist
assumption, that the “social ontology” is composed mainly of classes
interacting with each other.</p>

<p>In the 1857 “Introduction”, however, Marx makes a different argument.
Against the “individual and isolated hunter and fisherman” of Adam Smith
and David Ricardo, and against the “naturally independent, autonomous
subjects” brought together by social contract (as Rousseau saw things),
Marx argues that, rather than the starting point of a historical
process, the individual is rather a result of particular historical
(economic, social, political) dynamics. “The more deeply we go back into
history,” he writes, “the more does the individual, and hence also the
producing individual, appear as dependent, as belonging to a greater
whole… Only in the eighteenth century, in ‘civil society’, do the
various forms of social connectedness confront the individual as a mere
means towards his private purposes, an external necessity”
(<em>Grundrisse</em>, p. 84). The starting point is <em>society</em>, and exchange
between individuals came afterwards.</p>

<p>Indeed, this is one of the arguments that David Graeber makes in his
<em>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</em>. Against the view of many mainstream economists, that money arose out of the
need to make barter (i.e. direct exchange) more efficient, Graeber
argues that pre-capitalist, communal societies had no need of money
because they did not barter; indeed, there was no exchange within the
community at all. Graeber writes that anthropologists have found no
evidence of a society with barter as its main or exclusive form of
exchange; barter tended to be an external exchange, between communities.
Within communities, distribution of produced goods were handled without
exchange.</p>

<p>There are two conclusions to be drawn here. The first is simply a
methodological one. It is important to bear in mind one’s epistemological
and ontological assumptions. It is easy to reassert the hegemonic
(liberal) assumption rather than questioning it. Lately I’ve been
digging into Roy Bhaskar’s “critical realism”, a methodology which seeks
to overcome the limitations of both positivism and hermeneutics, the
contradiction between agency and structure. As
Andrew Collier writes in his introduction to Bhaskar’s work, <em>Critical
Realism</em>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Societies (composed as they are of relations between people, and
ramifications of thos relations) can only exist as the outcome of human
agency. If we were not reproducing/transforming social relations all
the time, they would not exist: that is the truth of ‘humanism’. But
all human action presupposes the prexistence of society and makes no
sense without it. Its social context determines what actions are
possible and what their outcomes will be. That is the truth of
structuralism… [however] the total social process is… the interaction of two distinct kinds of entity, societies and people.” (145)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Burnham et. al., in <em>Research Methods in Politics</em> argue that critical
realists “are united in their rejection of pure forms of individualism
and collectivism, pointing instead to notions of ontological depth,
stratification and emergent group properties” (35), which aligns
critical realism, I think, with the case Andreas Malm makes for
historical materialism in <em>The Progress of this Storm</em>.</p>

<p>The wider, and more important, point, I think, in insisting on the
original communal society over the primacy of the individual, is that it
opens up whole vistas of choices and alternatives to the
individualistic, economistic status quo we are constantly being told is
either natural or optimal (or both), but which has not only brought us
to the brink of climate catastrophe, but has opened the door (yet again)
to criminal regimes which look to murder anyone that does not fit their
definition of a human being, all while relying on “exchange between
individuals” to line their pockets (and the pockets, as <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/brazil-canada-trade-bolsonaro-politics-foreign-policy-1.4878379">CBC has
demonstrated</a>, of their foreign investors). Rejecting methodological individualism, at least until the historical and anthropological evidence is conclusive, should help us open our minds to new possibilities, to imagine worlds different than this one. But as long as cultural artefacts like <em>The Good Place</em> continue to offer up individualism as gospel, those of us who take a different view have a hard road ahead.</p>
