<p>As part of yesterday’s “Diversity Day” at University of Alberta
Libraries, Jessie Loyer gave a thought-provoking workshop called “Where
do you work? Rooting responsibility in land”. The workshop was
essentially a set of guided questions on land, indigeneity, settler
rights and responsibilities, sovereignty, communities, and
relationships. When I got home I decided to reread her chapter in <em>The
Politics of Theory and the Practice of Critical Librarianship</em>,
<a href="https://mruir.mtroyal.ca/xmlui/handle/11205/361">“Indigenous Information Literacy: nêhiyaw Kinship Enabling Self-Care in
Research”</a>. This
chapter is worth reading for many reasons, but I was particularly struck
by the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For [Deborah] Lee, reciprocity is a key element for librarians to
engage meaningfully with the information needs of Indigenous students,
particularly as librarians work against the commonly held perception
that interactions with non-Indigenous people will be disappointingly
non-reciprocal. (148).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Loyer is referring to Deborah Lee’s “Aboriginal Students in Canada: A
Case Study of Their Academic Information Needs and Library Use” 
from 2008. What is important here to non-Indigenous librarians - and
non-Indigenous people in general - is the characterization of
interactions with non-Indigenous people as non-reciprocal. I don’t think
answers like “colonialism” or “racism” tell the whole story, though they
are important elements of the story. In Loyer’s workshop, it was very
clear that reciprocity, relationality, and responsibility are tightly
interwoven not only within Indigenous perspectives on social relations, but
in what Indigenous people are looking for or need in their relations
with non-Indigenous people that we aren’t providing.</p>

<p>Much of the time - and this is clear in much of the Equity, Diversity,
and Inclusion work being done within LIS - we fall back on a
(philosophically) idealistic view of social and political change:
problems, tensions, or contradictions in our social relationships are
simply due to the wrong ideas, mistakes, or incomplete/erroneous
knowledge. Fixing the ideas, completing or correcting knowledge is the
answer to fixing our social relationships. This idealism was critiqued
by Marx and Engels in the <em>German Ideology</em>, and by Lukacs in <em>History
and Class Consciousness</em>, but it is a very hard position to escape from,
because it seems much easier to change people’s ideas than to change the
material structures that produce those ideas in the first place. So, to
come back to the incapacity for non-Indigenous people to engage in
reciprocal relationships, I would argue that the problem isn’t only with
people who don’t <em>want</em> to engage reciprocally, or those who don’t
understand what a reciprocal engagement <em>is</em>, though these are definitely
problems we need to face; rather, I would argue that settler inability
to form reciprocal relationships, to take responsibility for ourselves
and for others <em>with care</em>, and to see ourselves in a web of relations
that includes family, community, the social world, and the natural
world, are products of particular ways in which our (settler) social
world is materially structured. This is not to say that individuals
within capitalism are unable to perceive and work towards such
reciprocity and relationality: I’ve seen it mostly recently first-hand in the interactions of people
like Emily Drabinski, Tara Robertson, and Baharak Yousefi. But in the
aggregate, as a society, capitalism prevents us from having reciprocal
relationships, from taking responsibility, and for situating ourselves
with respect to others.</p>

<p>In the 1843 <em>Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts</em>, Marx argues that the
institution of private property, and the act of producing for another
(i.e working for a capitalist) combines to alienate human beings from
themselves, from each other, and from nature. Such alienation is at the
<em>heart</em> of capitalist economic and social relations, and explains not
only the capitalist drive to destroy the earth, but also the drive to
destroy culture, to reduce all differences to the least common
denominator, to make the world homogeneous and everyone the same (unless
a given difference can be “monetized”). These
institutions and dynamics also lead us to treat everything (ourselves,
each other, the natural world) as <em>instrumental</em> in the achievement of
some kind of goal, effect, or profit. As long as settler-colonialism is
capitalist, as long as we continue to make private property and
commodity production the basis of our economies, society, and politics,
we will continue to be <em>incabable</em> of reciprocal relationships or of
treating our relationships as anything but instrumental. This
instrumentality lies at the heart of all extractive activity, from the
extraction of natural resources which are destroying the planet, to the
extraction of data and information from Indigenous communities with whom
we have no ongoing reciprocal relationships, to the disproportionate extraction of labour
(both physical and affective) from Indigenous interns, library workers,
faculty, and researchers. This instrumentality also tends to be highly
individualist, another consequence of the logics and relations of
capitalism, which both reinforces idealism and blocks authentic
relationships. From this perspective, if we are serious about
decolonization, reconciliation, and building relationships with
Indigenous communities, then we have to be anti-capitalist.</p>

<p>The conflicts between Indigenous people and non-Indigenous people in the
colonial world tends to be reduced to simplistic - Westernized - ideas of property
rights, sovereignty, or - as we can see at Mauna Kea - a conflict
between “Western science” and “Native spirituality”. This reductiveness
clearly serves a political and ideological purpose among
settler-colonialists, but it also obscures what is really going on. The
conflict between Indigenous valorization of reciprocity, responsibility,
and relationships and capitalist alienation is the crux of a conflict between capitalism and
alternative modes of production. The plural here is important: the
reduction of the rich variety of Indigenous forms-of-life to a single
phrase (which I’m afraid I’m guilty of here too) is an easy trap for
settler-colonialists to fall into: capitalism prefers dichotomies. But
this should not obscure the rich plurality of alternatives that are on
offer in our struggle <em>against</em> capitalism and <em>for</em> responsible
relationships with each other and with the planet.</p>

<p>A few years after the <em>Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts</em>, Marx and
Engels summed up the question of alienation in <em>The Communist
Manifesto</em>. There, they wrote that capitalism has destroyed all the
organic, reciprocal, responsible relationships between human beings, and
“has left remaining no other nexus between [human beings] than naked
self-interest, than callous ‘cash payment’” (82). This “cash nexus” is
the antithesis of reciprocal relationships, and we can see this every
time we pay someone rather than have to enter into some kind of
dialogue. The cash nexus - alienation - is perhaps  <em>the</em> most
corrosive aspect of capitalist culture, and it is <em>this</em>, the idea that
every relationship must be one of self-interest, of extraction, of
non-reciprocity, that prevents settlers from engaging with Indigenous
people the way that we should.</p>
