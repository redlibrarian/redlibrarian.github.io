<p>Yesterday, a <a href="http://kevinseeber.com/blog/amber/">blog post by Kevin
Seeber</a> was making the rounds, and
while it struck a chord with a lot of people, I think there are some
problems with the way Seeber frames the question of collections. Mainly,
I think the problem is that while Seeber is right that “libraries have
been moving collections and discarding stuff for a long time now”,
without engaging with the specifics of moving and discarding now, in the
neoliberal conjuncture, Seeber risks ignoring the ways in which
processes which have been part of librarianship for a long time are
<a href="https://journal.radicallibrarianship.org/index.php/journal/article/view/25">increasingly
subsumed</a> within a capitalist regime of labour. While collection
management and weeding may be basically the same activities that they
were a hundred years ago, the socio-economic conjuncture in which those
activities are situated has changed, and to ignore that change, and the
ways in which librarianship (like all academic labour) has become
subject to commodity logic - and fetishism - plays into the hands of the
capitalist subsumption of academic and library labour itself.</p>

<p>There are other reasons to quibble. When Seeber says that he “didn’t
think that speed of access was as much of a concern for humanists who
spend years preparing a monograph”, he seems to betray, I think, a misunderstanding
of the <em>writing</em> process, an artistic process (yes, even scholarly writing) that is intuitive and extremely sensitive to the kinds of flows and disruptions Seeber discounts.</p>

<p>But the part of the blog post I really want to focus on is what Seeber
says about “serendipity”. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s not “serendipity” that put those books there and you’re not
“discovering” them. There’s a lot of nerve on display when faculty
question librarians and lament the decisions we make, but maybe the
most galling is the repeated insistence that the forces of fate have
connected them with these books. It’s not the heavens smiling on you
when you browse the stacks and find a relevant item, it’s the labor of
a bibliographer, a cataloger, and a shelver. This stuff ends up where
it does because people are doing the work of putting it there. And oh
yeah, another part of making it “discoverable” is removing all of the
stuff that’s no longer relevant. Librarians call it “weeding” for a
reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the first place, this mistakes the serendipity of the library user
with a non-existent or illusory serendipity of the books on the shelves. When
library users talk about serendipity, they are referring to a subjective
experience, the discovery of a book they didn’t know about as a happy
coincidence, due to its presence next to a book they knew about. Or the
discovery of important books in a location (stack) they thought to
visit. The presence of the books on a particular shelf in a particular
order, devoid of the noise of outdated or irrelevant material, is of
course no accident, happy or otherwise. But the subjective experience of
the browser is no less real for all that. There are two kinds of
serendipity being employed here, and Seeber’s dismissal of the
subjective experience of the browser is due to his only recognizing one
of them.</p>

<p>As I mentioned on twitter, even if we agree that “serendipity” is the
wrong word, we would still need to come up with another word that
properly describes that sense of a “happy accident” by which one
discovers a book one wasn’t looking for. I’ve been using the word
“discover” deliberately here, because it is the aspect of “discovery”
that touches on the question of the erasure of labour.</p>

<p>Very often when something is “discovered” in an archives, archivists and
librarians make the valid point that it was not discovered in the sense
of a discovery in the natural sciences. Active human labour went into
the organization and “discoverability” of archival material, the finding
aids, the organization of physical space, the maintenance of the
building, the organizational entity in which the archives is situated.
We are embedded in a chain of labour that stretches from my own
individual subjective experience of work horizontally throughout the
world of human life, and vertically through larger and larger
abstractions of labour organization and management. We are right to
speak up for the labour of all those who organize and make available
documents, records, books, and all other kinds of information. But there
is always a sense that the ignorance of all that labour that goes into
one act of subjective discovery is simply a moral failing, that if only
researchers or faculty would just <em>smarten up</em> then they would see all
the labour that goes on around them.</p>

<p>But this is an idealist view of the world. Many of the complaints made
by librarians and archivists that our work is not valued - as if any
workers’ labour is valued under capitalism - seems to suggest that the
question of how labour is valued is only a question of knowledge or
ignorance. The idealism comes in when
we expect that if people <em>think differently</em> then the material
conditions of our labour - our lack of recognition, in many cases poor
conditions of work, lack of prestige, feelings of alienation, etc - will be <em>solved</em> by people
thinking differently. This ignores the <em>material</em> reality of the
capitalist system in which we work, a system which is structured (physically,
mentally, ideologically, culturally, politically) to erase the work of
labourers.</p>

<p>It may seem as if I am contradicting myself: how can the subjective
feeling of serendipitous discovery on the part of a browser be
legitimate and <em>at the same time</em> the erasure of labour be taking place
and be a significant aspect of the capitalist labour regime? I am
contradicting myself, but as Georg Lukacs has argued, contradictions
exist in capitalist reality; they cannot be overcome except by
overcoming the material conditions that give rise to them.</p>

<p>For Marx, the increased (and today almost universal, at least in the
capitalist centre) socialization of labour was a product of the division
of labour (as in Adam Smith’s (in)famous pin factory) reaching such a
pinnacle that no worker sees the raw materials they work with as the
product of another’s labour. The very logic of capitalist production,
the very mystification of the commodity-form itself, leads to what Marx
calls “fetishism” (and is often nowadays called reification): mistaking
the relations between people for the relations between things. Because
we are alienated from the products of our labour, from each other, and
from ourselves, it is <em>impossible</em> for us to see commodities that we
work on, produce, purchase, or consume as the products of an almost
infinitely complex web of labour relationships. And while I think it’s
good to try to constantly remind people that all of the <em>things</em> they
engage with in their lives, including stacks and books and finding aids
and records, are the products of human labour, we mustn’t fall into the
trap of thinking that one day, if we just convince everyone, if all
these misguided fools would just free their minds, then all will be
well. The contradictions of
capitalism can only be overcome when capitalism itself is overcome, and
this can only take place through organization and resistance.
Resistance, if it is to mean anything, must include a resistance to the
forces of commodity logic, and this requires a critical perspective on
how and why the context of library work has changed and is changing for
the purposes of increased capitalist exploitation and oppression.</p>
