<p>I don’t normally weigh in on scholcomm discussions, as that isn’t really
my area. However, reading Aaron Tay’s interesting blog post <a href="http://musingsaboutlibrarianship.blogspot.com/2018/08/can-posting-preprint-be-morally-wrong.html">“Can
posting a preprint be morally
wrong?”</a>
got me thinking. The issue Tay is investigating is the <a href="https://medium.com/@OmnesRes/the-biorxiv-wall-of-shame-aa3d9cfc4cd7">bioRxiv preprint
wall of
shame</a>
and hinges on questions of what constitutes a preprint, what the purpose
of a preprint is, and when is the ethically appropriate point to deposit
a preprint (i.e. make it publicly available). None of these questions
are settled and they are still points of contention. It seems to me,
however, that there are two points which I don’t see discussed in the
literature. The first is the question of (private) property, and the
second is an epistemological question around texts and truth.</p>

<p>These two notions tend to get confused: bioRxiv’s policy of allowing
preprints only of articles that haven’t yet been accepted to a journal
can be seen as an assurance of quality (peer-review as truth-procedure)
but also a protection of a journal’s IP (publishers are always talking
about the value they add to an edited, published version of an article
or monograph). So by increasing the temporal distance as well as the
material qualities between the preprint and the published version, a
publisher decreases the competition between manifestations of the same
work (to use the vocabulary of FRBR).</p>

<p>There are disciplinary differences at play here. In the humanities,
articles are texts whose form is integral to the value of the content;
they are rhetorical in a way that scientific articles are not. Peer
review of humanities articles tend to focus on argumentation, textual
coherence, communication/communicability, etc. Preprints are less common
in the humanities precisely because the “final form” of the text is
integral to the communication of the argument. In the sciences, in
principle, the content of the article is distinct from the form that
it’s in (of course any humanities or social sciences scholar would take
issue with this claim). Peer-review takes account of knowledge claims,
methodologies, reproducibility, etc. In principle, peer review of
scientific articles acts as a mechanism to ensure methodological
guarantees of validity. A preprint exists on one side of this mechanism,
marked by a kind of <em>caveat emptor</em>. It makes sense, then, for
scientists to expect the provisional knowledge claim of their article to
be replaced (epistemologically) by the peer-reviewed version when that
comes to exist. The peer-reviewed version <em>supersedes</em> the preprint in a
way that makes little sense for humanities articles (where revisions
tend to be thought of as drafts or refinements of argument and
language). But this idea of supersession in terms of knowledge claims
ignores the question of property (as indeed, it should): to a
scientists, the knowledge produced by their research ought to be
independent of considerations of property; peer-review is a mechanism of
externally validating a knowledge claim, and is (in principle)
independent of the editorial work done by a journal.</p>

<p>For journals, however, peer-review is a step in the editorial workflow;
it is a way to <em>add value</em> to a commodity, hence the requirement from
their perspective a) to
distinguish between preprints and published version b) quash competition
between preprints and published versions (i.e. through policies
preventing accepted manuscripts from being deposited as preprints) and
c) through selective manipulation of open-access mechanisms such as
Creative Commons licensing (as the recent Elsevier discussion
illustrates - see the ALA Scholcomm listserv archive for details).</p>

<p>This is all a good example of how capitalism coopts non-capitalist
procedures and values (e.g. peer-review as knowledge validation) for
private profit. It relies on the multivalent aspects of peer-review: it
can function as an epistemological mechanism (for scientists) <em>and</em> as
an editorial, value-adding workflow component (for publishers). In this
way, scientists submit to peer-review for their own disciplinary and
methodological reasons, but thereby end up contributing to an ecosystem of
private property and profit.</p>

<p>This all becomes clear when we consider the vilification of postprint
deposit (again, relating back to the <a href="https://www.jcel-pub.org/jcel/article/view/7415">Elsevier CC
“loophole”</a>). For
instance, when Jordan Anaya
<a href="https://medium.com/@OmnesRes/the-biorxiv-wall-of-shame-aa3d9cfc4cd7">writes</a>
that “the fact that you can post a bunch of postprints to bioRxiv, then
list them on your resume as evidence for your dedication to open science
is disgusting”, he is arguing for the disinterested promotion of open
science (i.e. with peer review as methodological validator); but by
decrying the open-deposit of postprints, Anaya is supporting bioRxiv’s
property rights in the articles it publishes. The insidiousness of
capitalism is laid bare when Anaya argues that “our goal wasn’t to
publish a paper, it was to share our results and code, which is what
open science is supposed to be” <em>at the same time</em> as he is supporting
bioRxiv’s property claims to accepted manuscripts.</p>

<p>I don’t know if there is something like an unaffiliated peer-review
network in the works; this would be the peer-review equivalent of the
open knowledge base discovery and e-resources librarians are waiting
for, a way of taking methodological mechanisms out of the hands of
vendors, separating an infrastructure from its matrix of private
property and profit. Until then, I think, the ambiguities, tensions, and
contradictions present within the scholcomm world are not only going to
remain, but are likely to get worse as new forms of competition (i.e.
SciHub) challenge the processes and profits of corporations; such is the
way capitalism is designed to work, after all.</p>
