<p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the gender pay gap (especially in
universities, because that’s where I work). Over the last few years,
some Canadian universities (e.g.
<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/female-mcmaster-professors-getting-a-pay-boost-to-same-level-as-men-1.3052626">McMaster</a>
and
<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/university-of-waterloo-boosts-female-faculty-salaries-after-gender-pay-gap-found/article31272503/">Waterloo</a>)
have done internal studies to determine the
extent of the pay gap and have implemented pay raises in order to
compensate and help close the gap. There are some standard
“justifications” raised against the idea of a gender-based pay gap,
none of which are worth trying to rebut, for example that women don’t
ask for pay raises, a canard which has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/gender-wage-gap-women-pay-raise-men-study">thoroughly
debunked</a>.
As I’ve been working my way through Marx’s <em>Capital</em>, however, I began
to wonder what the economic justification and mechanisms were (and by
this I don’t mean what are the <em>avowed</em> economic explanations, but what
are the underlying dynamics of capitalism that create the conditions for
a pay gap along gender or racial lines).</p>

<p>Marx starts out with a very simple question: when we exchange two
commodities, how do we determine their value? His answer to this is that
value is created by human labour: the labour theory of value which he
took over from (e.g.) David Ricardo, states that human labour creates
value which is then “embodied” in the commodity. This value is
immaterial and not easily measurable, since its measure is really the
“socially necessary labour time” embodied in the commodity. Over time,
one commodity becomes a “universal measure” of any value, and we end up
calling that commodity money. So, we can say that any output of
production has value through being a product of human labour, and this
value can be measured in money.</p>

<p>Money, Marx continues, is not the same as capital. The capitalists have
to have a reason to bring labour and raw material together, to advance
their own money to set up in industry and produce commodities. This
incentive is profit, which returns to the capitalists after they sell the
commodities they have produced. The question now becomes, how does the
magnitude of value increase during the process of production, so that
the commodities are worth more when they are sold than the raw materials
and labour costs that went into them? In other words, where does the
profit come from? (Capital is money that performs this operation of
regularly increasing value).</p>

<p>Since the capitalist pays money for raw materials and for human labour,
and only human labour can create <em>new</em> value, the extra value (what Marx
calls <em>surplus value</em>) can only come from value added to the commodity
<em>that the capitalist has not paid for</em>. But how can this be, considering
that workers sell their labour to capitalists on the free market? Surely
the workers are capable of demanding the wage they want! (See here how
the arguments for lower wages for women are the same as the arguments
used to justify worker exploitation at the time Capital was written). The
price of the commodity “labour power” (what the worker has to sell) is
set on the market the same as everything else: it is the cost of all the
commodities that went into its production, so the wages that a worker
can command are equal to the amount of money spent on creating them as a
worker (this explains why people with degrees are paid more in our
society: all the money laid out on making them the worker they are goes
into the price they can command for their labour power). Let’s say the
worker asks for $100 per day in wages and in 8 hours of work produces
$100 of value - in that case no surplus value is produced and the
capitalist receives no profit. The task of the capitalist is therefore
to try to get the worker to produce <em>more</em> than $100 worth of value in
an 8 hour day.</p>

<p>There are many ways that this can be done. Marx distinguishes between
lengthening the working day and increasing the productivity of labour. Iff the worker produces $100 in 8 hours,
they will produce $150 in 12 hours, even if they’ve already agreed to be
paid only $100) and if, trough
increased automation for example, a worker can now produce $150 worth
of value in 8 hours, but you still only pay them $100 dollars, then in
both cases $50
of surplus value is produced and pocketed by the capitalist.</p>

<p>But the capitalist can never stop at, say $50 worth of profit, because
all the other capitalists are competing to increase their own profits,
making it harder and harder to create surplus value anywhere. So the
process continues, with capital constantly seeking new ways to cheapen
labour and to increase productivity. Looked at from this angle, any
<em>social</em> mechanism by which lower pay for <em>some labour</em> can be justified (i.e. labour
performed by women) is worth it as it increases the amount of surplus
labour performed by women, and hence the surplus value derived from
their work. These social mechanisms are present as flat-out misogyny,
but also operate in less direct ways (it has been suggested for example
that women are subtly disadvantaged during salary negotiations).</p>

<p>Lenin referred on more than one occasion to the bribery of the upper
levels of the working class, the raising of their standard of living to
bring them around to support the status quo. The reason for increased
exploitation of women with respect to men, is that enables male workers
to be bought off by being in a better situation (this too manifests
itself in insidious social ways, corrosive to both men and women). What
has been said here applies to any group (i.e. new immigrants, racial
minorities, etc.) which can be exploited to a
higher degree and played off against other groups within the working
class. One thing to bear in mind (especially among male workers who are
happy with their lot) is that, under capitalism, <em>all</em> workers are
exploited, all workers are forced to produce surplus value. What we have here is a
condition in which women are <em>more</em> exploited because they are women.</p>

<p>It seems clear to me that <em>all</em> Canadian universities (not to mention
all other workplaces) ought to be immediately implementing plans to
investigate the pay gap and take measures to close the gap. If not
proposed by university administration, it ought to be a plank in all
upcoming collective bargaining. Reducing the rate of exploitation of
any and all members of a collective bargaining unit ought to be a
priority for the unit as a whole. It’s something, indeed, that would be
worth striking over.</p>
