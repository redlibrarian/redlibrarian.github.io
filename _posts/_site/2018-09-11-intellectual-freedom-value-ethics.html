<p>This morning I went to the Edmonton Public Library’s Leader-in-Residence
panel on Intellectual Freedom. Toni Samek, Jim Turk, and Gail DeVos were
the panelists and it was moderated by Alvin Schrader. I didn’t know Gail
DeVos, but Toni, Jim, and Alvin have all been active participants in the
intellectual freedom sphere - in libraries and academia more broadly -
for a long time.</p>

<p>I found the whole experience highly demoralizing. As Toni pointed out,
this debate comes to a head about every thirty years, dating from the
Library Bill of Rights in the late 1930s, through the Social
Responsibility movement of the late 1960s, the late 1990s, and again
today. And it appears that every time this cycle comes up, the same
arguments are rehashed again and again.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, this is unsurprising. Both the mainstream,
hegemonic, liberal position on intellectual freedom <em>and</em> the social
justice perspective on social responsibility are partial viewpoints
caught within the limits of capitalist society. The racism, sexism,
ableism, hatred of trans people, or Muslims, or Jews, are not accidental deviations from a
“free” society of civil liberties and rational debate, but are
structural requirements of a capitalist social order that profits off
division, violence, and hate.</p>

<p>So when intellectual freedom proponents speak of civil liberties,
freedom, democracy, and self-fulfillment/realization - when they are not
in bad faith - they presume that these things somehow exist in
capitalist society, that they are defending their existence in the face
of extremism on one side or the other. But freedom does not exist in a
society based on coercion; self-fulfillment/realization is precisely
what is denied to workers alienated from the products of their labour,
themselves, and each other. No amount of defense of “both sides” or
“objectivity” or “fairness” can bring into being something so fantastic.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the social justice critique of the hegemonic liberal
position is often little more than “yes, buts” - taking the liberal
perspective for granted, but trying to get the other side to see the
error of their ways. This is a classic example of a dialectical
contradiction. More information or better arguments will not solve this
problem, because the problem exists in reality, it is part of the fabric
of capitalist society. Proponents of the hegemonic, liberal perspective
are untroubled by the social justice arguments. When we bring up “safe
spaces” they can take the broad middle road and ask us to have a bit of
sober perspective.</p>

<p>The reason, I think, that we go through this “debate” every thirty years
or so is that the problem of the contradiction between intellectual
“freedom” and social responsibility is insoluble under capitalism; it
can only be solved in a future society, one separated from us by
revolution, and which can only be reached by way of revolution. That
society would require us to take a larger perspective on the question,
a perspective broader than either the partial viewpoints of intellectual
“freedom” or social responsibility. A viewpoint that would take
advantage of a new social structure to overcome the limitations of this
one.</p>

<p>What would that look like? I think it would have to recognize that if
libraries claim to have values, those values can either be progressive
or reactionary (leaving out the discredited claim to value-free
“neutrality”). Reactionary values would indeed require a radically
different kind of library, but since libraries never claim to hold
reactionary values, we can focus on the other alternative.
Progressive values have long been part of the library discourse (whether
that be in support of democracy itself or merely - as a recent New York
Times article has it - civil liberties). But to have values means that
we think those values are important enough to actively promote, support,
and maintain. We can’t be satisfied simply with <em>saying</em> we hold
progressive values. And yet, this is what we do when we give bandwidth,
air-time, or oxygen to hateful, corrupt, or reactionary values. To claim
a set of progressive values but to do nothing to uphold them is not
having values at all - it is a return to the discredited notion of
neutrality, but this time in bad faith.</p>

<p>And we don’t need to give bandwidth to other perspectives. Like
collections, we needed to be comprehensive when there was no other
communications channel, when information could be had through the
libraries and almost nowhere else. But this is no longer the case. The
Steve Bannons and Jordan Petersons of this world don’t need our help
getting their message across. This is a change that clearly
librarianship (like journalism) has found it difficult to deal with. In
a world of limited bandwidth, an attempt at fairness, balance, “both
sides”-ness might have been laudable. We did not have the luxury then,
perhaps, of living up to our values. Now that bandwidth is abundant, to
pay lip service to progressive values without doing more to uphold them
is unconscionable.</p>

<p>Ideally, every library would decide for itself, among the collectivity
of its staff, what its role is and what values it decides to uphold.
However, we (library workers) are not in charge of our libraries. Our
libraries do not serve their publics, they serve the universities and
municipalities in which they are embedded, and who have goals which may
be (often are) not in line with our professed values. But workers don’t
have the luxury of quitting a workplace that doesn’t share their
values (despite what proponents of the free exchange of the labour
market maintain).</p>

<p>The hegemonic, liberal perspective might be understood as a
deontological ethics - there are rules to liberal society (like the
fairness of representing both sides) and we must uphold them. The social
justice perspective is often a form of consequentialist ethics (if we
host Jordan Peterson then we are causing harm to our public).
Interestingly, I think this is the same distinction at play in arguments
over the Williams-Osaka USOpen final. On the one side, we have those who
claim that “there are rules in tennis that must be followed”
(deontology), while on the other side we have arguments around the
effects of structural racism and sexism (consequentialism). To take a
larger view, we could say that professional tennis is a multi-billion
dollar industry predicated on certain structures of race, gender, and
class, which will never be overcome within the constraints of either the
sport or capitalist society at large.</p>

<p>In his
book <em>Marxism and Ethics</em>, Paul Blackledge argues that - despite Marx’s
own claims to the contrary - Marxism holds a position of virtue ethics,
in other words, what is the right thing to do? Blackledge writes,
“Instead of focusing on the intentions of actors or consequences of
actions, virtue ethicists insist that they key ethical question should
be ‘what kind of person should I be?’” (p. 33). If we claim to hold
progressive values, then we need to live up to those values, not
sidestep them. If we
want to be moral librarians working in moral libraries, then we need to
take a perspective broader than both the deontological and
consequentialist perspectives while, at the same time, bearing both
those perspectives in mind.</p>

<p>Regarding a proposed Marxist ethics,
Blackledge writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marxist ethics therefore presuppose an unbreakable unity between the
facts and the condemnation of exploitation and alienation on the one
hand, and the means to an end of socialism on the other. While modern
moral philosophy is a reified reflection of our alienated existence
under capitalism, Marxism, both as an explanatory account of the
dynamics of capitalism and as a condemnation of this system, is rooted
in the collective struggle of workers for freedom. Practice does not
and cannot follow theory in the way that modern moral theory would have
us supposed, for it is universally true that we can theorize only from
specific standpoints. Marx thus criticized liberal moralists for being
unable to offer an adequate account of human action. By contrast,
because he made his own standpoint explicit he revealed not only the
limitations of modern moral theory, but also the unity, but not
identity, of socialism, social science, and moral realism. (p. 97)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I’ve done before, I’m calling for a <em>partisan</em> librarianship, one
which decides on what a moral profession looks like, and acts according
to that decision. But that decision has to be a collective one, a social
one, and I’m afraid it will never happen within a capitalist economy,
politics, and culture. A partisan librarianship must, therefore, also be
a revolutionary librarianship.</p>

<p>Now, this in itself might sound complacent, as if we will need to wait
for the revolution before doing anything. But I don’t think that’s the
case. What we need, in the absence of a socio-economic structure which
will allow for collective life, is an “intellectual politics” (in place
of a non-existent intellectual freedom). We have to <em>reject</em> the rules
of liberal society - the rules of fairness and “the marketplace of
ideas”; indeed, we need to reject the market itself. And we need to
reject the framing of the problem that we inherit from liberalism and
from our parent institutions. For example, so many of our intellectual
freedom discussions focus - as it did today - on the intellectual freedom of our users, the
public; intellectual freedom is outward-facing. We should reject the
exclusivity of that 
framing, and insist on dealing with the huge problem in our profession
of the intellectual freedom of public library workers being sacrificed in
favour of a liberal hegemony or the market (the library’s “brand”). An
intellectual politics would insist on trying to live up to our values,
even if we fail. A lot was said today about allowing different voices to
be heard; we have to start with the voices of public library workers, or
we can never hope to approach the kind of collective action needed for
the thorough transformation into the society to come.</p>
