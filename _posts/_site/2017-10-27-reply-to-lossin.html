<p>When David Camfield drew my attention to Rebecca Lossin’s “Against the
Universal Library” (<em>New Left Review</em> 1-7, Sept-Oct 2017) I was
initially surprised that anything to do with libraries would appear in
the NLR. The long-standing traditions of critique within modern librarianship,
dating from the 1930s and the establishment of the Library Bill of
Rights, through to the debates around intellectual freedom and social
responsiblity in the 1960s and 1970s, and continuing to this day in the
various forms and emphases of the Progressive Librarians Guild, the
critical librarianship (#critlib) movement, and the work being done by
Library Juice Press, to name just a few tendencies - tend to seem rather
provincial against the backdrop of broader left critique. In some ways,
Lossin’s critique - an intervention in the name of the printed book -
aligns with at least some of these movements. But Lossin’s portrayal of
a homogeneous, monolithic library profession is at odds with the
presence of this trend of debate and these tendencies themselves.</p>

<p>Many of my colleagues, I know, would agree with Rossin’s criticism of
the transition from “library science” to “information science”, and
there is indeed much to criticize. The fact that what librarians think
of as “information science” and what computer scientists mean by the
term marks a disconnect between two modes of thought. And it is easy to
point to a neoliberal fetishizing of the technological as one of the
prime movers behind this transition. This critique of “iSchools” and
“information science” programmes is widespread in the library world. And
so when Lossin remarks that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>from what I observed during my studies, information professionals, true
to their elastic and unbookish titles, were fans of just about anything
that was not a book. They thought putting video games in the young
adult section was a great idea. They talked constantly about
‘rebranding’ the library via Facebook - which still, unfortunately, has
the word ‘book’ in it. They even found a way to rename books: as
budding information professionals, we were encouraged to use the unsexy
– if still suggestive – term ‘information package’ instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes it sound as if everyone except Lossin, professors and
students alike, form a homogeneous bloc fully and enthusiastically in
favour of the neoliberal colonization of librarianship. This is at odds
not only with mine and others’ experience of library school, but of the
profession at large. “Information package” is not in common usage,
certainly not to refer to individual e-books. The only time I hear it in
the wild is, sometimes, from database vendors referring to a collection
of aggregated electronic articles, which are indeed packaged up
together. It is a mistake, I think, to argue that librarianship as an
undifferentiated whole supports the technocratic instrumentalization of
information. Like any other profession, some of us struggle against
hegemonic logics and concepts that have been reified and overvalued
within our institutions and society at large. At the risk of sounding
like a Hardt-and-Negrian, libraries contain multitudes.</p>

<p>I also think that the root cause of this process is misidentified by
Lossin, who argues that the renaming of “book” to “information package”
(and all the attendant rationalizations and justifications) are due to a
single technological moment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This name-change was the product of the rise of digitization. Books
were being removed from the professional vocabulary because they were
being removed from the shelves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leaving aside the fact that “book” remains an integral part of the
vocabulary of librarianship (and the silent elision of “book” with “codex”), ascribing a (putative) devaluing of the book to a single cause - digitization - oversimplifies matters.</p>

<p>Have print codex collections declined, or at least slowed? It’s likely -
University of Alberta Libraries has an “electronic preferred” policy 
where, absent any counterargument, an electronic copy will be acquired
if one exists. I’m not a collections librarian and I haven’t done the
number crunching, but it seems likely that some material formerly
acquired in print is now only being acquired in electronic format. But
this is less the result of “digitization” than of changes within the
wider economy of book production, libraries’ relationships to vendors,
and the dynamics and constraints of parent institutions.</p>

<p>Electronic books acquired by collections librarians are rarely
“digitized”. Digitized material tends to be archival, special, or unique
material that is digitized and put online both to broaden the use of
that material, to protect the material (sometimes, <em>contra</em> Lossin,
damage to books can be irreparable and the book itself irreplaceable).
Making versions of unique items available beyond the walls of the
physical library was one of the recognized benefits of print - a
manuscript had to be laboriously copied by hand in order for anyone to
be able to read it outside the location in which is happened to reside.
Digitizing rare or archival material satisfies the same need. And these
are not, as far as I know, destructive of the material being digitized;
this would defeat the purpose.</p>

<p>The majority of electronic books acquired by libraries are born digital,
that is, they exist electronically alongside a print version; indeed the
print version is often produced from - and after - the electronic
version. In this sense then, the question of the shift from print books
to electronic books becomes one of the lowering the cost of the means of
production, and changing the nature of labour involved, that is, it
becomes part of the ongoing process of capital accumulation. To posit
“digitization” as the <em>cause</em> of a devaluing of the print book misses
this aspect of the process.</p>

<p>Because book publishers have moved towards electronic books as cheaper
and easier to copy and distribute, vendors push for libraries to acquire
them rather than print books. I’m not denying that a similar logic is at
play <em>within</em> libraries - electronic books don’t require shelf space or
workers to move the books around, for example - but that this logic is
not particular to libraries, it is general to the mode of production
that sees automation and digital production as a means to cheapen if not
discard labour power in the centres of capitalism. It should not be
surprising that libraries as institutions find it difficult to resist such logics; libraries too are subject to austerity and all the other dynamics of neoliberalism.</p>

<p>Academic libraries are embedded within universities, colleges, etc, and
public libraries are situated within municipalities, all of which are
subject to socio-economic and ideological pressure to conform to
neoliberal structures of thought and behaviour. Decision-making in
libraries is far from distributed or non-hierarchical, and
decision-makers self-select through their conformity with the
requirements of the capitalist university or the austerity municipality.
This supports Lossin’s contention that neoliberal changes have been and
are being wrought within libraries, but it challenges her assertion that
every librarian must be on board with these changes. We struggle, though
the struggle often looks and feels futile.</p>

<p>Lossin argues that “Libraries, in their attempt to ‘future-proof’
themselves… are importing both commercial practices and logics into
nominally alternative spaces”. “Nominally” in what sense? Libraries have
never been pure, alternative spaces safe from commercial practices and
logics. There has been a lot of work done on the role of libraries in
both the self-reflection of bourgeois ideology, the ideological
conditioning of the working class, and the construction of canons and
epistemes that support dominant power structures. Again, Lossin’s view
of libraries seems oversimplified, and she sets up a false dichotomy
between a pure alternative space and a corrupt commercial institution.
But there are no pure spaces untouched by capitalist logic,
exploitation, and domination.</p>

<p>Lossin’s account of the various destructive processes that have taken
place throughout the history of libraries is not <em>wrong</em> - indeed, the
destruction and repurposing of paper (and of rags to make paper) is as
old as the book itself. I’m just not sure what her point is - librarians
don’t destroy books because we hate paper and love whatever the new
technology is, and the process of destruction identified by Baker was
never a uniform, homogeneous process either. We are all, always negotiating social, economic, political and, yes,
epistemic changes like everyone is. Where I do take issue with Lossin’s
argument is the idea that the episodes she mentions</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>are the logical conclusion of a set of techno-fetishistic practices
that have shaped the culture of libraries over time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would argue that, with technology being such an integral part of the
process of capitalist accumulation, both of value and of ideology and
culture, we can’t escape some form of techno-fetishism. Indeed, the very
qualities of the printed book Lossin writes about mark a
techno-fetishism of her own, since the printed book is itself a
technology. All this may make it sound as if I am unsympathetic to
Lossin’s argument, but I’m not. I agree that reading something in print
is different (and, in my opinion, worse) than reading it electronically.
But Lossin’s view seems to oversimplify and overgeneralize the process
she is describing, and ignores the hegemonic realities librarians live,
work, and struggle in. I think it also ascribes single causes to what
are in fact overdetermined processes. Digitization of material aids in
accessibility (a screen reader can read an electronic text; an
electronic text can easily be converted to various accessible
formats). The presence of electronic materials also allows for quick and
easy satisfaction of a reader’s immediate needs - patron-driven
acquisition systems, for example, would be inconceivable in a print only
world. And this, I think, is at the heart of my critique of Lossin’s
argument: she posits too many false dichotomies - information
specialists vs. librarians, the status quo vs. her solitary voice, print
vs. electronic. The truth is that both the symptoms which she diagnoses
– which in general I agree with – and the causes of those symptoms are
  much more complex than she allows. Like librarianship itself.</p>

<p>This blog post can’t do justice to everything in Lossin’s article, which
ranges widely, and certainly raises important points about the
directions and dynamics of libraries (and librarianship) under
capitalism. Libraries and librarianship continue to have major problems
with respect to labour, gender, sexuality, class, and disability, many
of which we are ill-equipped (culturally, politically, ideologically,
and theoretically) to address. But librarianship is full of
countertendencies, debates, argument, and critique, and to pose -
simplistically - that librarianship is purely the preserve of
philistines and crypto-fascists is, in my opinion, wide of the mark.</p>
