<p>I’ve been thinking a lot lately about alternatives to exchange
economies, prompted by David Graeber’s analysis of the mythical origins
of exchange and money in his book on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years">debt</a>. One
thing that Graeber discusses is that, contra the bourgeois economists and
contemporary hegemonic thinking on the subject, members of ancient societies did not
exchange amongst each other - they didn’t barter within a community,
which then led to a search for efficiencies in the form of money and
asynchronous exchange. Rather, ancient communities had various ways to
handle the distribution of produce that did not use exchange, and
exchange (primarily barter) was employed <em>between</em> societies or
communities, not within them. Graeber, an anthropologist, mentions a few
specific examples, but the clearest illustration for my purposes is probably the
Iroquois matriarchal form of centralized distribution. Graeber writes
that while Adam Smith erected his theory of barter leading to money on
books found in Scottish libraries, he ignored the anthropological work
of Lewis Henry Morgan, which had been widely published by the middle of
the 18th century. According to Graeber, what Morgan found was that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the main institution among the Iroqois nations were longhouses where
most goods were stockpiled and then allocated by women’s councils, and
no-one every traded arrowheads for slabs of meat. (Debt, 29)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I haven’t followed up to see what other anthropologists or
Indigenous peoples themselves currently think about Morgan’s work, but
it’s a good illustration of one possible way a community can exist
without exchange. Such a system should also
dispense with the mystification around scarcity that exists in
capitalist society. Because of the division of labour, the mystification
of the labour process, the three-fold alienation which Marx identified
in the <em>1844 Manuscripts</em> (in capitalist society, a person is alienated
from the product of their labour, from society, and from themselves),
“abundance” and “scarcity” become impossible to see directly, mediated
as they are by the market (i.e. supply and demand). This allows for
scarcity and abundance to be manipulated - hoarding, surge pricing, etc,
all being examples of this. But perhaps the most insidious result of the
mystification of abundance and scarcity is the idea of scarcity itself.
As Marx and Engels wrote, capitalism is the most productive economic
system every created, and yet it is plagued by this idea of scarcity.
Not enough jobs to go around (blame immigrants), not enough money for
government services (blame scroungers), not enough money in an
individual’s bank account (blame taxes). And this economic logic seeps
into other areas of life, as the capitalist mode of production
increasing restructures human society in its own image for its own
purposes.</p>

<p>There was an interesting thread on Twitter last week about how the
idea of scarcity affects marginalized communities. For example, the <a href="https://simmons.libguides.com/anti-oppression#s-lib-ctab-10174165-1">transmisic</a> justification for
arguing that trans women are not women or trans men are not men appears
to be
based on some strange equation between scarcity/abundance (in
terms of opportunities, rights, etc.) and identity. This arithmetic is
both dangerous and unnecessary, and is imported wholesale from our understanding of market
(that is, exchange) relationships. The idea of exchange underpins many (but not all) of the ways we attempt to justify social exclusion,
marginalization, and hatred. This isn’t surprising because capitalism
profits from precisely those things as it pursues ever-expanding
accumulation. If we can think of our social relationships as an economic
equation in terms of who gets to consume (scarce) resources in exchange
for what, if we seek to maximize efficiency and utilization of resources
in our non-economic relationships, then we are turning them into
economic relationships, making them - all of a sudden - prime targets
for capitalist profitability. (Side note: this is what has happened / is
happening with the neoliberalization of higher education: the more we
employed capitalist assessment criteria and metrics, the more we became
easily assimilable to the capitalist mode of production, and guess
what… that’s where we are now).</p>

<p>In his analysis of Volume 1 of <em>Capital</em>, Fredric Jameson argues that
“Marx’s version of the labour theory of value dramatically solves one of
the age-old mysteries of the market (how can anyone make money out of a
fair exchange?)” (<em>Representing Capital</em>, 12). Of course, Marx’s answer
is that the exhanges that <em>seem</em> fair under capitalism (labour
contracts, especially) hide a structurally necessary power imbalance and
mechanism of exploitation. It would not be wrong to say that under
capitalism there <em>are no fair exchanges</em>, just as <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wi1QIgG.jpg">there’s no such thing
as ethical consumption</a>. But what is
significant here is the idea of “fairness” itself. As Graeber says with
respect to debt, it is <em>immoral</em> to not repay a debt. Maurizio
Lazzarato, drawing on Nietzsche’s <em>Genealogy of Morals</em> shows that
neoliberal financialization has in fact not only produced people who are
universally indebted (an economic situation), but who are defined by their ability to keep their
promises (a moral situation). Economics and morality are thus bound up
with each other: morality becomes one of the tools of economic
reproduction, capitalist reproduction.</p>

<p>I don’t want to spend more time on Lazzarato’s <em>The Making of Indebted
Man</em>, but it’s a really fascinating book, and I recommend it. Instead, I
want to turn to a source that most people will likely find odd for me to
use: The Gospel of Matthew. There are a lot of political lessons to be
drawn from Jesus (I’m especially partial to “the Sabbath was made for
man, not man for the Sabbath”, which to my mind stakes out a position
against rule-based ethics), but two moments in particular are
significant for this discussion. First, Matthew 14:15-21:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a
desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that
they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals. But Jesus
said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. And they say
unto him, We have but five loaves, and two fishes. He said, Bring them
hither to me. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass,
and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven,
he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the
disciples to the multitude. And they all did eat, and were filled: and
they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full. And
they had had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and
children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice how the disciples’ response to scarcity (“this is a desert
place”) is to break up the community and to send the multitude to engage
in exchange (“buy themselves victuals”), while Jesus argues that, for a
community, there can be no scarcity, because of the means by which a
community centralizes and shares (distributes) its produce. Community
thus takes ethical and ontological priority over economic relationships
like scarcity and exchange.</p>

<p>Next, in Matthew 18:22:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin
against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him,
I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read this as Jesus arguing against the idea of fairness in exchange.
Peter wants to know what the going rate of exchange is between sin and
forgiveness, he is looking for a calculus, a criteria for default.
Jesus’ position is that a relationship of love and forgiveness can and
must exist beyond such logical calculus of value and exchange.</p>

<p>These examples illustrate that not all economic and ethical issues are
new to capitalism, but they achieve particular resonance under capitalism.
For me, the kind of communism that Marx and Engels argue for can be
thought of in this way (taking care to avoid the utopianism of the
early-19th century socialists): that in order achieve a society not
based on exchange, the tyranny of economic “fairness”, and exploitation,
we have to give up this idea of debt, repayment, value, equality,
measure, etc., and live together as a community rather than - as the
bourgeois economists would have us believe that we are - an aggregation
of individuals bound together solely by economic bonds (that is,
exchange relationships). Jesus argues for this kind of perspective time
and time again. Turning the other cheek is not (or not only) about
meekness, but about abdicating a particular form of repayment. The political thought of Jesus, while wrapped
in a mystical shroud I have difficulty accepting, can still be understood as
providing particularly radical illustrations of the unnaturalness of
economic logic, especially when it seeps into our social relationships.</p>

<p>It is important, I think, to continue to imagine utopian solutions to
these kinds of quintessentially practical problems. Practical solutions
are always conditioned by economic logic, the logic of scarcity,
exchange, and value. As a different Twitter thread discussed this
weekend, the failure of our political solutions is often a failure of
imagination. It’s important to keep the unrealistic, utopian ideas in
play so as not to abandon the field to the domination of economic logic
and the dehumanizing calculation of human lives.</p>
