<p>This weekend, I attended the <a href="http://albertaopendatasummit.ca/">Alberta Open Data Summit</a>. It was very interesting to hear from libraries working with open data, but also to hear from all the ‚Äúpolicy wonks‚Äù about their vision of how Open Data can support municipal policies around inclusion, social welfare, etc. The keynote was be Jean-No√© Landry, Executive Director of Open North, who discussed some of the initiatives that have grown out of the Open Data movement in Montreal. One of the things he talked about was indicators of maturity within the Open Data movement. <a href="https://tpavlek.me/blog/2016/10/16/alberta-open-data-summit/">Troy Pavlek</a> has given a good summary of the conference and has a photo of Landry‚Äôs slide in his blog post. The main indicators from Landry‚Äôs point of view are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>From <strong>apps</strong> to <strong>systemic</strong> change</li>
  <li>From data <strong>visualization</strong> to <strong>interactive online tools</strong></li>
  <li>From <strong>hackathons</strong> to <strong>sustained engagement</strong> processes</li>
  <li>From <strong>demand</strong> to <strong>context</strong> specific data user approaches</li>
  <li>From <strong>champions</strong> to <strong>mindset shift + capacity building</strong></li>
  <li>From open <strong>data portals</strong> to <strong>personalized dashboards</strong></li>
  <li>From <strong>local policies</strong> to <strong>global frameworks</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>All of this is well and good, however, something bothered me with the
state of the discourse throughout the conference. I tweeted at the time:</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been thinking more about this since the conference, and there are
two things I‚Äôd like to tease out here. One is that another indicator of
maturity within the field is precisely the problematization of the
positivist, technocratic view of open data; and the other is the
question of science, as it‚Äôs understood within the Marxist tradition.</p>

<p>The dominant narrative in the Open Data movement seems to be that social
problems (e.g. government accountability, homelessness, etc)  have
technological solutions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Freely available for anyone to access, use and re-use, these data bring
immense transformation to the table: from better-informed people,
through more transparent governments to safer and highly-efficient
living environments. <a href="http://ontotext.com/connectivity-open-data-and-a-bag-of-chips/?utm_content=buffereded6&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">Connecivity, Open Data, and a Bag of

<blockquote>
  <p>Improved access to data will bring substantial benefits to the third
sector, and so to society. <a href="https://theodi.org/blog/better-access-for-more-impact-what-open-data-can-offer-the-third-sector">Better access for more impact: what open

  <p>Access to (open) data will help prevent duplication, uncover funding

significantly improve how donors target their aid. <a href="http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/updates/open-data-and-agricultural-aid-next-step-tackling-hunger/">Open Data and

<p>This kind of technocratic positivism reminds me of the state of
musicology before the publication of Joseph Kerman‚Äôs <em>Contemplating
Music: Challenges to Musicology</em> (1985). Prior to this, music was
considered autonomous, above and apart from social, economic, political,
and even cultural determinations. Kerman‚Äôs book was part of a movement
towards situating musical culture within a social framework, that saw
music as part of other social trends, pressures, determinations, etc.
Needless to say ‚Äútraditional‚Äù musicologists saw this ‚Äúinjection‚Äù of
worldliness, of critique, as an affront to the pure, scientific positivism of their
worldview. I would argue that what the Open Data movement requires now
is just such an injection of (that unpopular word) theory. Without it,
it risks being coopted into the neoliberal structures of metrics,
analysis, big data, surveillance, and the replication of traditional
(white, male, middle class) hierarchies of social control. The adoption
of open data policies by capitalist governments cannot and will not
<em>automatically</em> address social problems, exploitation, poverty,
homelessness, etc. To argue that all that is required for governments to
become accountable and progressive is the availability of data implies
that social problems are merely failures in knowledge, and ignores the
facts of structural inequality, relationships of power and privilege,
and class struggle within capitalist society.</p>

<p>This <em>question of knowledge</em> raises its head everywhere. The idea that
injustice, inequality, and oppression can be overcome simply by
improving knowledge ignores both the question of power (and how it is
maintained) as well as ideology and ideological reproduction. At bottom
is an Enlightenment assumption that knowledge is perfectable and perfect
knowledge leads to perfect societies - an idealism that is at odds with
the Marxist understanding of the material world.</p>

<p>The question of the distinction between science (true knowledge) and ideology (false knowledge) has long been of interest to Marxist theorists (notably in the work of Louis Althusser). For Georg Lukacs, writing in the 1920s, the Marxist theory of knowledge was qualitatively different from the theory of knowledge tacitly assumed by bourgeois science. In <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/history/orthodox.htm">What is Orthodox Marxism?</a> he writes that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The methodology of the natural sciences‚Ä¶ rejects the idea of
contradiction and antagonism in its subject matter. If‚Ä¶
contradictions do spring up between particular theories, this only
proves that our knowledge is as yet imperfect. Contradictions between
theories show that these theories have reached their natural limits;
they must therefore be transformed and subsumed under even wider
theories in which the contradictions finally disappear. (10)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A classic example of this is the subsumption of Newtonian physics under
Relativistic physics, but this process is well-documented in Thomas
Kuhn‚Äôs <em>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> (1962). For Marxists,
however, Lukacs goes on,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>in the case of social reality these contradictions are not a sign of
the imperfect understanding of reality; on the contrary, they belong
to <em>the nature of reality itself and to the nature of capitalism</em>.
When the totality is known they will not be transcended and <em>cease</em> to
be contradictions. Quite the reverse. They will be seen to be
necessary contradictions arising out of the antagonisms of this system
of production. When theory (as the knowledge of the whole) opens up
the way to resolving these contradictions it does so by revealing the
real tendencies of social evolution. For these are destined to effect
a real resolution of the contradictions that have emerged in the
course of history. (10-11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At issue with the positivist approach to Open Data is the suggestion
that open data, and therefore improved knowledge, is all that is
required to overcome the contradictions and oppressive structures of
society. And the risk with this kind of thinking is that the opening up
of data can become an end in itself; the open data movement might then
stop once it has accomplished everything on the right hand side of
Landry‚Äôs list (personalized dashboards, for example) without going
further, using Open
Data to expose the real inequalities, power dynamics, and oppressions of
society, ‚Äúand by opposing, end them‚Äù.</p>
