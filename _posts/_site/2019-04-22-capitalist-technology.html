<p>An <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613310/congress-wants-to-protect-you-from-biased-algorithms-deepfakes-and-other-bad-ai/">article by Karen Hao from April 15th</a> described a (long-overdue) trend
in the capitalist centres to start taking seriously the idea of
regulating artificial intelligence. A bill before Congress, the
Algorrithmic Accountability Act, “would require big companies to audit
their machine learning systems for bias and discrimination and take
corrective action in a timely manner if such issues were identified”.
Needless to say, this shift owes a lot to the work on algorithmic bias
and the technological reification of social structures in algorithms,
work by Safiya Noble, Virginia Eubanks, Zeynep Tufekci and others. This
work has exposed the very real problems with the technologies of the
current AI Summer.</p>

<p>In another recent article, <a href="https://medium.com/@biancawylie/sidewalk-toronto-violating-democracy-entrenching-the-status-quo-making-markets-of-the-commons-8a71404d4809">Bianca
Wylie</a>,
whose sustained criticism of Toronto’s Sidewalk Labs project has made
the social and political consequences of the project impossible to ignore, points out a very important facet of the “discursive struggle” around AI/technology in the current conjuncture. When Sidewalk Labs states that “sensors have become a part of our daily lives,” Wylie identifies the rhetorical ploy being used:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Passive language, without agency. As though the sensors and cameras
just sprouted into the world, without creators or purchasers, without
contracts or decisions. This subtle normalization is the work to
guarantee that a quantified city becomes the social norm. And of course
it will come with a side of greenwashing in the rhetoric, to make sure
that you might hesitate or feel a sense of social pressure to get with
the program - you’re not anti-sustainability, are you? The quantified
‘resilient’ city is key to opening up new markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They key here, from my perspective, is markets. In response to the Karen
Hao article, I wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regulating AI/technology under capitalism is meaningless, because
technology plays an <em>intrinsic</em> role in capitalist development.
Technological change is not some independent process, or subject merely
to the whims of silicon valley.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, as Wylie points out, machine learning and Big Data did
not just “sprout into the world”, but are the products of the decisions
made by real people in a very real mode of production. However, the
creators and purchasers <em>also</em> did not appear in the world fully-formed,
independent, and autonomous. Their choices and decisions are also
structured and constrained by the logic of capital. To paraphrase
Voltaire, capitalists and workers did not exist, so it was necessary
for capitalism to invent them. (NB: I’m leaning pretty heavily on the
structuralist account of capitalism, which plays down the agency of
workers and capitalists; the truth is, as always, more dialectical).</p>

<p>So what do I mean by technology’s intrinsic role in capitalist
development? For Marx and Engels, technology is a fundamental element in
humanity’s relationship to the world. Tools connect the human being and
the objective world, and tools/technology evolved alongside human beings
through the work that we accomplished through the mediation of the tools
themselves. In <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1876/part-played-labour/"><em>The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to
Man</em></a>,
Engels argued that the further away from the direct employment of tools
(including our bare hands) the more mystified our relationship to
technology became:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All merit for the swift advance of civilisation was ascribed to the
mind, to the development and activity of the brain. Men became
accustomed to explain their actions as arising out of thought indetead
of their needs… and so in the course of time there emerged that
idealistic world outlook which, especially since the fall of the world
of antiquity, has dominated men’s minds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This idealism expresses itself in today’s world in many different ways:
in the idea that algorithms are “just math” (pure, ideal, and therefore without
bias); in the idea that passing a law automatically affects the material
conditions of production; and in Apple’s injunction to just “think
different” in order to achieve the kind of lifestyle we have been
marketed and sold since the Second World War.</p>

<p>But the most insidious kind of idealism is that which sees technology as
neutral tools, whose use has been perverted by amoral Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs, corrupt politicians, and greedy CEOs. This is the view of
technology (and technological progress) shared not only by the
capitalist world as a whole, but of the Marxists of the Second
International and the Bolsheviks. Until Raniero Panzieri’s re-evaluation
of technological progress in the 1950s, technology was believed to be
“class neutral”, and the same technological restructuring of work was
bad for workers in the US and good for workers in the USSR.</p>

<p>For Marx, on the other hand, technology under capitalism is capitalist
technology - that is, when capitalism is the dominant mode of
production, all technology serves the purpose of capitalist exploitation
and expansion. Technology, in Marx’s view, is a means for lowering the
cost of labour and (in the short term at least) of increasing profits.
Technological development is a site of the struggle between labour and
capital, but it is also the site of competition between capitalists.
Every technological advance lowers the cost of labour for first
capitalist that employs it, but as that technological change becomes
widespread, every capitalist shares in the lowering of labour costs, and
the competitive advantage of the first capitalist is lost.</p>

<p>AI, machine learning, and Big Data, are simply the latest technological
development in this ongoing struggle between labour and capital, and
between capitalists themselves. The automation of factory work that
began in the 1950s and 1960s dispensed with the need for human workers
on assembly lines (replaced with robots). The current AI summer is
simply seeking to automate facets of labour (intellectual and emotional
labour) which were previously beyond the reach of automation. In
addition, surveillance and platform capitalism - neither of which is
radically <em>new</em> - use surveillance and platform technologies to harvest
micromoments of labour, represented as data, both for direct
exploitation and for more subjective conditioning and structuration of
workers (as Phoebe Moore’s work on <em>The Quantified Self</em> and Maurizio
Lazzarato’s on “machinic subjection” can attest).</p>

<p>In this context, the attempt to regulate AI technologies without
dismantling the capitalist system can be seen as today’s equivalent of
safety regulations around assembly lines. While it <em>may</em> save some
lives, regulations also play their part in the disciplining of labour
(because they are capitalist regulations), but they also allow for their
own quantified logic of injury and death: how many injured or dead
workers are acceptable compared to the cost of compliance?
Technology and regulation under capitalism - capitalist regulation and
technology - is constrained by this kind of profit/loss logic precisely
because capitalist technology is a tool for the increase of profit.
Indeed, this is the logic surrounding the gradual improvement of facial
recognition software. The racist biases built into facial recognition
are, it is argued, temporary, and a small price to pay for the
eventual benefits of facial recognition. We should sacrifice the
people whose lives are ruined by the false positives and other
algorithmic injustices in order to benefit from future profit. This has
always been the logic of capitalist development: the sacrifice of the
poor, oppressed, and marginalized in order to wring <em>more</em> and <em>more</em>
profit from the system over time. This is the logic, after all, that has
led us to the brink of unavoidable climate disaster.</p>

<p>The idea that we can wish away (with laws formulated by the capitalist state)
the worst abuses of capitalism is a pipe dream. Despite the imputation
that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/20/jordan-peterson-slavoj-zizek-happiness-capitalism-marxism">anti-capitalists are literally
insane</a>,
we can’t pick and choose individual parts of the mode of production for
our analysis, critique, or material attack. Capitalism <em>as a whole</em> has
to go; only then can we regain some relationship with our tools and with
the natural world not driven by the inhuman and dehumanizing logic of
profit and the cold calculus of the expendability of human lives. The
climate catastrophe that is nearly upon us makes this problem (and
project) more urgent than ever.</p>
