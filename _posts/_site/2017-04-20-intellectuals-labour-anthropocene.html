<p>My proposal had been submitted last year and I had been planning to
attend the upcoming <a href="http://litwinbooks.com/laac2017colloq.php">Libraries, Archives, and the Anthropocene
Colloquium</a> hosted in New
York by Litwin Books, but due to the unethical travel ban implemented
since then by the US Government, <a href="http://bibliocracy-now.tumblr.com/post/156651067775/should-i-travel-to-the-united-states">I have decided not to travel to the US
for the time
being</a> and I withdrew from the colloquium.</p>

<p>I had, however, done a fair amount of work on a draft of a paper looking
at various Marxist strands of ecological thinking, and I thought that
there was enough there to share on this blog. I donâ€™t have plans to
finish and polish up this paper, so it might as well go out into the
world. Maybe it will be of use or interest to some.</p>
