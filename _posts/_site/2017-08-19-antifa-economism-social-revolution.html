<p>In <em>What Is To Be Done?</em> (1902), Lenin wrote that without an organized
party to push demands further, the working class would never move beyond
‘economism’, that is the demand for purely economic betterment: higher
wages, benefits, etc. These demand would leave the social and economic
foundations of society intact.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Taken by themselves, these strikes were trade-union struggles, not yet
social-democratic struggles. They marked the awakening antagonisms
between workers and bosses; but the workers were not, and could not be,
conscious of the irreconcilable antagonism of their interests to the
whole of the modern political and social system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An intact capitalism leads, as we know, to increased alienation,
ever-worsening economic crises, and eventual collapse. <em>In the
meantime</em>, capitalism remains based on inequality and exploitation
supported by domination and oppression. Our understanding of social
forces is not as black and white as Lenin’s; it includes different
determinations alongside class: race, gender, sexuality, (dis)ability…
but the fundamental antagonisms are economic. The others - racist,
sexist, ableist, unfold out of the consequences of the commodity form
and the drive for profits based on exploitation and domination. The
racist, sexist, and xenophobic ultra-right is a product of the
insecurity and violence of capitalism, and it is only by attacking the
socio-economic causes of fascism that we can defeat fascism. The focus
on “punching Nazis” as an end in itself seems to me to be the equivalent
in 2017 of economism in the early 20th century.</p>

<p>The last few years have seen an awakening of a radical social-justice
worldview, including movements coming out of Black Lives Matter, radical
feminism, Pride, and disability activism. This has coalesced, in parts
of the US at any rate, in a strong current of resistance of neoliberal
policy, especially that attacking social services and environmental
protection. But the neoliberal policies that have produced left-wing
resistance have also produced the rise of a far-right emboldened by what
they see as the victory of a new political class committed to the return
to a capitalist golden age in which the “old stock” white male will
regain his privilege over the rest of the world. The violence of
“austerity” and hyper-exploitation have produced both an enlarged (if
incoherent) left and an open far-right. Merely identifying the far-right
as the focus of our anger and work leaves the real evil - the logic,
structures, and policies of capitalism itself, to continue to operated
without hindrance.</p>

<p>This has been apparent most clearly since last weekend when antifascists
dispersed a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The
rise of openly racist, sexist, and fascist white supremacists in the
States has given many people a target to fight against - a target the
left has sorely needed. Punching Nazis is on the agenda, and while
punching people isn’t my bag, it at least gives people on the the left
the feeling that they are accomplishing something practical - something
ostensibly “left wing” institutions (unions, the NDP, the Communist
Party of Canada) have completely ignored for as long as I can remember.</p>

<p>Much of the impetus behind punching Nazis comes, I think, from a frustration with attempts (and I
used the word advisedly) to argue with far-right fascists. They are
experts at using the language and arguments of social justice against
us, even when they are interesting in arguing at all, and not merely
derailing argument. Punching Nazis carries the satisfaction of cutting
through the sophistry and bullshit and seeing an immediate effect. But
eventually we have to come to the realization that punching Nazis is not
enough, just as arguing with them is not enough. In the end punching
Nazis will seem just as tedious and pointless as arguing with them has
been. We will need to continue to stand up against them, but we will
feel like we aren’t getting anywhere.</p>

<p>Because the far-right is a consequence of capitaism, and not a thing
in-and-of-itself, fighting and even vanquishing this round of fascists
without overturning capitalism leaves the causes of fascism intact. The
social inequality and economic crises of a capitalism hellbent on the
commodification of everything, ever-increasing profits, and the forced
adoption of the capitalist mode of production all over the globe
(colonialism, imperialism).</p>

<p>Punching Nazis is satisfying and worthwhile, but it can never be
<em>enough</em>.</p>

<p>Fighting fascism might result, in the end, in a temporary setback,
perhaps even in a political revolution - transfer of power in the US
government, for example. But it would leave existing social and economic
relations untouched. Racism, sexism, all forms of oppression and
domination would remain precisely because the fundamental oppression of
economic exploitation remains. What is required instead is a social
revolution, in which the very relations of social and economic
relationships of society are completely overturned.</p>

<p>I think what I’m getting at is summed up in this meme. The image is
perhaps satisfying in its attempt to get at the long history of
left-wing antagonism towards the right (seen, for example, in the
resistance of anarchist and communist forces against fascism in Italy
and Spain). But it obscures, even violates, some vital historical
realities. In the first place, the majority of German and American
soldiers were not ideological supporters of the regimes they fought for,
except in the sense of having been targets of propaganda and the general
capitalist worldview gained through what Althusser called the
“ideological state apparatuses”. They were neither alt-left nor
alt-right. In addition, the clash of ideologies obscures the
socio-economic of the Second World War. Like the First World War -
indeed, part of a single historical process along with it - the Second
World War was between competing capitalist powers for control over
economic space. Hitler’s process of annexation and conquest was the move
of an economic power blocked from colonial expansion by the terms of the
Treaty of Versailles. The eventual “victors” of the Second World War
(the United States) immediately expanded its imperial pretensions in a
world suddenly free of (almost all) competing powers. To see the Second
World War as a clash of fascist and liberal ideologies, with the
liberals coming out victorious, is not only historically obtuse, but
serves to further the interests of liberalism itself: the expansion of
cqpitalist accumulation.</p>

<p>We need to be able to see beyond this kind of cynical manipulation. If
you’re going to go punch Nazis, do it with your eyes open. It is not
only the far-right that is used to co-opting the language and arguments
of its opposite. Capitalism itself has proven itself to be expert at
turning the energies and organizations of the left to its own advantage.
The only way we can create a new and better world is by social
revolution. Nazi punching is a milestone on that road, but we can’t stop
there.</p>
