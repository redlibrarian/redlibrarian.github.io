<p>This is the text of a talk I gave at the Digital Pedagogy Institute last
year at University of Toronto, Scarborough. There has been a lot of
discussion around the question of library workers learning to code, and
this was my attempt to set out my thoughts on the subject. I realize
that the term “coding” is ambiguous and arguable, but I hope this text
lays out a particular way of approaching the question.</p>
