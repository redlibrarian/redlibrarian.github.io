<p>In <a href="http://www.open-shelf.ca/160615-karl-marx/">Karl Marx and Critical
Librarianship</a>, John
Pateman, CEO of Thunder Bay Public Library, seeks to provide a Marxist
framework for a “Needs Based” library model. In 2008, Pateman wrote in
<em>Information for Social Change</em> on <a href="http://www.libr.org/isc/issues/ISC26/articles/26%20Developing%20a%20Needs%20Based%20Library%20Service.pdf">“Developing a Needs Based Library
Service”</a>
which, while not naming Marx directly, did refer to Marx’s statement in
the <em>Critique of the Gotha Programme</em> (1875) (taken from Louis Blanc).
“From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”.</p>

<p>For Pateman, it seems, Marx’s ideas are the bedrock on which the “Needs
Based Library” could be founded. I say “could” because in neither
document is the “Needs Based Library” posited as anything more than an
abstract, aspirational model which returns libraries to a purported (but
unsubstantiated) tradition of democracy and social justice which Pateman
believes libraries have diverged from.</p>

<p>It seems to me that Pateman’s reading of Marx does not do justice to the
sophistication and nuance of Marx’s theoretical contributions, but I
don’t want get into a debate about relative interpretations of Marx. I
do, however, want to point out a major absence in Pateman’s analysis,
one which has always been considered fundamental to Marx and to Marxist
analysis, the concept of <em>materialism</em>.</p>

<p>Pateman begins <em>Karl Marx and Critical Librarianship</em> by mentioning the
base and superstructure, by which Marx meant the ways in which economic
production was organized, and the culture, politics, social formations,
etc, which develop out of a given mode of production. In his sketch of
historical materialism published in 1859, Marx wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into
definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely
relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development
of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations
of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real
foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure and to
which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. (Marx, preface
to <em>The Critique of Political Economy</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The important thing here is that the “base” is material. The ways in
which we, as workers, interact with the world to satisfy our needs
(through work) is the foundation of the superstructure, and therefore of
all social forms and institutions (including libraries). The
relationship between the base and the superstructure is, of course,
dialectical, but Marxism is an economic determinism, and it’s important
to remember the importance Marx ascribed to material reality and the
relations that it engenders.</p>

<p>In this case, then, when Pateman states that “we can interpret the
Superstructure as the organizational culture […] and the Base as the
Strategy, Structures, and Systems” of a library, he is losing sight of
the materialist basis of capitalist production, and therefore confusing
what is an economic relationship, and what is, for want of a better
word, cultural. Organizational culture is obviously (but not merely)
cultural, but so are strategy (how and by whom is strategy decided),
services (what services, aimed at whom, provided how), and systems
(in Pateman’s view, systems are “policies and procedures”). We can
see the “superstructural” nature of these categories in the fact that
the actual relations of production (capitalist/funder,
manager, employee, “consumer”) remain unchanged.</p>

<p>I have to keep reminding myself that Pateman’s “Needs Based Library” is
not a description or a model of an actual existing library, but an
imaginary construct described using quasi-factual statements which, I’m
starting to realize, are not meant to be taken as descriptions of actual
fact (this was part of my problem with the CAPAL statement on collegial
governance). So that when Pateman writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Needs Based Library Service is both democratic and accountable.
Stakeholders include staff, partners, suppliers, service users, lapsed
users and non users. (Pateman, 2008)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He doesn’t mean <em>is</em> in any kind of descriptive or ontological sense. By
losing sight of the material forces and relations that actually exist in
society, Pateman seems to free himself from any actual constraint, and
confuse “should” statements with “is” statements.</p>

<p>So we end up back to the question I raised in my last blog post: who
signs the cheques? If Pateman’s Needs Based model is actually meant to
be realistically applied, how does his “constitution” deal, with the
realities of capitalsit relations, for example,
with collective agreements? How would a Needs Based public library
convince a (capitalist) municipal government to fund an organization
that tries to not base itself on capitalist relations of production?
Does a Needs Based library manage to exist in some kind of
non-capitalist space simply because it is an imaginable option? As
Gillian Byrne asked, does getting rid of traditional hierarchies simply
replace them with relations of personal domination? Pateman’s
constitution seems to imply that this would, in fact, be the case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The transparency of the Constitution means that you no longer have to
depend on office politics to get things done. With the Constitution
made accessible to everyone, anyone in the Library can quickly figure
out who owns what, the decisions he or she can make, and who to hold
accountable for which functions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Somehow, office politics would “wither away” once everyone knows “who
owns what”. This is precisely the idea that Lenin had which he belatedly
tried to deal with in his testament against Stalin, but to no avail.</p>

<p>Further reading in Marx might have led Pateman to two other salient
ideas, which appear in the same document as the discussion of the base
and the superstructure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of
society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or
– this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the
property relations within the framework of which they have operated
hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these
relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social
revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead sooner or later
to the transformation of the whole immense superstructure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for
which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations
of production never replace older ones before the material conditions
for their existence have matured within the framework of the old
society. Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is
able to solve, since closer examination will always show that the
problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its solution
are already present or at least in the course of formation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This indicates that economic realities, material relations between
people and classes, can’t be changed or overthrown simply by closing
ones eyes to them. We must have no illusions about how the mode of
production creates the labour and living conditions in which we find
ourselves. And it is only by changing the material basis of production
that we can permanently and thoroughly change the superstructure. By
ignoring, as Pateman does, the material constraints on our agency, he
loses a major component of the Marxist framework on which he bases his
library model.</p>

<p>In my view, Marx and Marxism are both valid bodies of thought for
critiquing the current model of librarianship, imagining alternatives
and, hopefully, pushing forward the kind of change Pateman is looking
for. But I don’t see the value in ignoring the very real material
conditions of our working lives in favour of what seems to be little
more than wishful thinking.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM: on applying Marxism to library work.
In discussing Pateman’s article, Jane Schmidt pointed out that details
of what an actual implementation of a Marxist model of libraries might
look like is still lacking. I don’t
have any fully-fleshed out thoughts or ideas on this topic yet,
but the more I think about it, the more I think that some kind of dual
power could provide a way forward. Dual power was a term coined by Lenin
to refer to the fact that, while the Tsarist and Provisional
Governments were still legally in control, the Soviets (councils) in
Moscow and Petrograd were providing social services and making political
and practical decisions without reference to the government. The <a href="https://ri-ir.org/2012/04/11/panther-dual-power-strategy-by-the-united-panther-movement/">Black
Panthers</a>
too, have exercised dual power to provide social services to
their communities in the face of an abdication by the US and state
governments. I still need to think more about this, but I wonder if
self-organization by library workers without attempting to overthrow the
decision-making apparatus, might be a way forward.</p>
