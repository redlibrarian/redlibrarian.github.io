<p>NOTE: What follows are a few notes on one aspect of the current ALA
debacle. <a href="https://aprilhathcock.wordpress.com/2018/07/11/my-bought-sense-or-ala-has-done-it-again/">April
Hathcock</a>
and <a href="http://seadoubleyew.com/rethinking-intellectual-freedom/">Carrie

both written more important and significant contributions, which you
should read before (or instead of) mine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The realm of freedom really begins only where labour determined by
necessity and external expediency ends; it lies by its very nature
beyond the sphere of material production proper… The true realm of
freedom, the development of human powers as an end in itself, begins
beyond [the sphere of necessity], though it can only fourish with this
realm of necessity as its basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marx, <em>Capital</em>, Volume 3: 958-9.</p>

<p>From a Marxist perspective, freedom is impossible as long as we live in
an unfree world. But Marx’s concept of “unfreedom” is more nuanced than
at first appears. The world is unfree not only because of the existence
of ICE, the monstrous separation of children and families in what has
looked like a police state since <em>at least</em> Ferguson, the draconian
race-based travel restrictions, or the active and passive censorship
conducted by government agencies. It is unfree because the material
foundation of society is built on coercion, exploitation, and
oppression. The history of colonialism and imperialism, the effects of
both on Indigenous people and transported slaves, are moments of
primitive accumulation that allowed capitalism to become the
self-reproducing socio-economic system we see today. But primitive
accumulation, as Silvia Federici reminds us, is not in the past. Unpaid
internships, zero-hour contracts, housework, etc, are all elements of a
continuing process of uncompensated labour, not to mention slavery
itself. Ta-Nehisi Coates’ (and others’) arguments in favour of
reparations for slavery, like the “Wages for Housework” movement itself,
is most significant in the way it brings this primitive accumulation out
of the shadows where capitalism has consigned it.</p>

<p>Apart from primitive accumulation we still live in a society of
compelled labour. As workers we have no choice but to sell our
labour-power in order to survive. In what sense can any kind of freedom,
including intellectual freedom and freedom of expression, be said to
exist? In no meaningful sense.</p>

<p>Then there is the social aspect of intellectual freedom. Historical
materialism argues that social institutions, norms, cultural
expressions, “structures of feeling” and “forms of life” arise from the
material - primarily economic - basis of society. As long as we live in
what might be called “pre-post-scarcity” world, our thoughts, our
speech, our expressions are in no sense “free”, unencumbered,
unconstrained.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the peculiar attachment many American have to this
idea of “freedom” stems from the concept’s place in their national myth
(and it is a myth). The freedom of the American republic (“We hold these
truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal…”) is
predicated on the <em>inequality</em> of some men and of most women. The
“freedom” of the republic has always been limited; an unlimited,
absolute freedom has only ever been <em>at best</em> a rhetorical move. In
other parts of the world we are less likely to evoke “freedom” as any
kind of absolute value or justification. There is also something here of
the “return of the repressed”, in that American freedom still today
relies on less freedom for some, from slavery, through Jim Crow, to
Ferguson, and beyond. “All men are created equal,” as Orwell wrote, “but
some are more equal than others”.</p>

<p>So it is hard to see the ALA’s Office of Intellectual Freedom hiding
behind this absolutist sense of intellectual freedom and freedom of
speech without thinking that they must not be as sure of their position
as they would like us to believe. Why was the wording of the amendment
seemingly rushed through? Why do so many ALA councillors feel that they
have been misled? The charitable view is that this was simply a
mistake, an inability to “read the room”, compounded by an inability to
acknowledge the mistake and make it right. But it’s also possible that
the absolutist view of intellectual freedom <em>really</em> does hold sway
within the OIF.</p>

<p>This too, could be a mistake, but it could <em>also</em> be an expression of
something altogether more troublesome: the weaponization of intellectual
freedom to protect a status quo that the defenders of the amendment are
perfectly comfortable with. I’ve written about the “aristocracy of
labour”, but I want, this time, to refer to a perhaps surprising source.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://anti-imperialism.org/2017/02/23/web-du-bois-marxism-and-the-negro-problem/">“Marxism and the Negro Problem”</a>(1933), W.E.B. Du Bois writes about
the distinction between the Black and White proletariat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This black proletariat is not a part of the white proletariat. Black
and white work together in many cases, and influence each other’s rates
of wages. They have similar complaints against capitalists, save that
the grievances of the Negro worker are more fundamental and
indefensible, ranging as they do, since the day of Karl Marx, from
chattel slavery, to the worst paid, serated, mobbed, and cheated labor
in any civilized land.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this division amongs the working class is what contributes to the
worst condition of the Black proletariat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lowest and most fatal degree of its suffering comes not from the
capitalists but from fellow white laborers. It is white labor that
deprives the Negro of his right to vote, denies him education, denies
him affiliation with trade unions, expels him from decent houses and
neighbourhoods, and heaps upon him the insults of open color
discrimination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The amendment to the Bill of Rights interpretation is yet another
example of this -  expanded, in this case, to <em>any</em> group that serves as
the target for one hate group or another. But equal opportunity to be
harassed, attacked, and discriminated against isn’t “equality” or
“freedom” either.</p>

<p>Du Bois’ prognosis is not positive; he sees no change in the condition
of the Black proletariat coming from socialism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reformist program of Socialism meets no response from the white
proletariat because it offers no escape to wealth and no effective bar
to black labor, and a mud-sill of black labor is essential to white
labor’s standard of living.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My own hope is that this division, too, is the product of economic
necessity and exploitation, and that it may be overcome with the
achievement of a new society. But the prospects are not heartening.</p>

<p>To be a white librarian arguing for an intellectual freedom that only
existed to serve white people; an intellectual freedom that never
existed outside the ideology of the white ruling class; an intellectual
freedom now weaponized for the benefit of those who would drive us
<em>further away</em> from what little freedom has been won over the
generations, is unconscionable.</p>

<p>Give up the fig-leaf of “absolute freedom”, look to other countries as
examples of how hate speech can be handled <em>without</em> calling down
unlimited government censorship, <em>listen</em> to what others are telling you
about <em>their</em> experience as people who have never been able to assume or
rely on freedom, intellectual or otherwise. Or, as someone else put it
on the <a href="https://www.oif.ala.org/oif/?p=14997">OIF blog</a>, get out of the way. Because if “intellectual freedom”
does not really exist, then what matters is to fight for something else.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I focused here on the question of race, as that seems to me the
clearest historical example of the fallacy of “freedom” in a “free
republic”, but I should make it clear that the hate groups in question
are not only racist, but sexist, anti-semitic,
homophobic, and in general against anything that marks people as
<em>different</em>.</p>
