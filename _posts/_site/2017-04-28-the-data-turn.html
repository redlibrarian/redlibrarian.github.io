<p>Big Data, analytics, data analysis, databases - all these have been with
us for years. But when Miriam Posner tweeted the above yesterday, I
began to wonder if we aren’t seeing a “data turn” similar to the
linguistic turn following the adoption of (primarily French) cultural
theory in the US in the 1970s and 80s. The inaugural issue of the
Journal of Critical Library and Information Studies contained <a href="http://libraryjuicepress.com/journals/index.php/jclis/article/view/22">“A Case
for Critical Data Studies in Library and Information
Studies”</a>
by Tami Oliphant, and the <a href="https://collectionsasdata.github.io/">“Collections as
Data”</a> recently released the
<a href="https://collectionsasdata.github.io/statement/">Santa Barbara
Statement</a>, suggesting
that that there is more to “data” than the narrow definition that might
be provided by, say, a database administrator.</p>

<p>The use of “data” instead of “sources” reminds me of the resistance to
using the word “text” to describe a non-textual object of interpretation. Yes, we can understand what Derrida meant, and we can recognize the characteristics shared by, say, a literary text and a non-textual object like a sound-recording. But we can also recognize that there is something metaphorical about the use of the word “text” here. Traditional scholars resisted describing non-textual objects as texts, and so it would be easy for us to suggest that today’s traditional scholars are also resisting the description of non-data object as data.</p>

<p>But what is non-data? There are common-sense understandings of “text”
and “data” that might indicate the dividing line between text and
non-text, or data and non-data. But where Derrida’s “il n’y a pas de
hors-texte” <em>could</em> be dismissed as cultural-theory-obscurantism, it’s
much more difficult for us to dismiss the idea that something can be “not
data”. We could describe non-data as something not amenable to
computation; we could also describe non-data as something which is
incapable of being used as the basis for information, but both of these
definitions seem particularly slippery. On the one hand, what’s
resistant to computation today may not be tomorrow (witness the albeit
narrowly focused advanced in machine learning lately); on the other
hand, defining data in terms of information seems too circular (“what is
information - something you drew from the data”).</p>

<p>In <em>The Prison-House of Language</em>, Fredric Jameson’s 1974 study of
Russian Formalism and Structuralism, he talks about the use of language
as a model for non-linguistic objects of study (the basis of
structuralism and post-structuralism).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The history of thought is the history of its models […] The lifetime
of any given model knows a fairly predictable rhythm. Initially, the
new concept relases quantities of new energies, permits hosts of new
perceptions and discoveries, causes a whole dimension of new problems
to come into view, which result in turn in a volume of new work and
research. (v)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Language as a model! To rethink everything through once again in terms
of linguistics! What is surprising, it would seem, is only that no-one
ever thought of doing so before; for of all the elements of
consciousness and of social life, language would appear to enjoy some
incomparable ontological priority, of a type yet to be determined. (vii)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I see in the discourse around “data”, and in the funding priority
given to, for example, data and digital librarianship, at the expense of
other, more traditional fields, is a commitment to data as a model, to
an understanding of data as having “ontological priority” in the world
of late/digital/cybernetic capitalism. And given that so much of our
daily life - from social media, to financial transactions, to industrial
production and circulation - is data driven, perhaps there is something
to this. The focus on metadata quality, linked data, and computation is,
perhaps, nothing more than the necessary response to cyber-capital’s
use of data as foundational infrastructure. <em>But</em>, we have to remember
that data is both “real” data and “metaphorical” data, just as a text
was sometimes textual and sometimes non-textual. And we have to bear in
mind not only the audience for our discourse, but the users of our data,
recognizing when they have need for, or are already using, real data or
metaphorical data.</p>

<p>In a sense, we have to work at several different levels at once. Jameson
goes on to say that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We may say that as a method, Structuralism may be considered one of the
first consistent and self-conscious attempts to work out a philosophy
of models (constructed on the analogy with language): the
presupposition here is that all conscious thought takes place within
the limits of a given model and is in that sense determined by it. (101)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We must be aware that while <em>we</em> think of things in terms of the model
(either a specific data model or <em>data as a model</em>), scholarship,
research, teaching, learning and other modes of life go on without an
interest in our model. The tribes studied by Levi-Strauss had no need
for his structural model of their society; they were just living. So we
don’t need to force our “data turn” on other kinds of researchers;
rather, we need to develop practices and construct systems that work on
real data models that are flexible enough to afford many different kinds
of engagement. This is not new, I think, to anyone who works with
library systems and data, but it is important, I think, to bear the
“unreal” nature of all models in mind as we go along.</p>

<p>And this is where I think the problem lies. There’s a hermeticism to a
lot of technical library work (whether that’s systems, cataloguing, or
metadata), that tries to ignore the broader social context of the
decisions being made. We might be user-focused, we might try to
future-proof our decisions, but fundamentally, we follow best practices
that are based on professional practice and knowledge (metadata and
cataloguing) or institutional culture (systems and development), all of
which are
slow to change and averse to changing too radically. If, indeed, we are
going through a data turn, then in Marxist terms, our knowledge and
practices are becoming fetters on the work that we need to do. But the
main culprit, from my perspective, is an organizational culture that
<em>has</em> no model, that is a collection of ad-hoc decision-making processes
(almost exclusively top-down) that are focused on getting as much out of
the
neoliberal dynamics of a university or municipality as possible, rather
than on leading an organization into a position where we can explore and
support the data infrastructure which enables scholarship and research,
and is both methdology and object of study.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, as <a href="https://twitter.com/RachelMFleming/status/857964516591710209">Rachel M Fleming noted this
morning</a>
we need a much firmer grasp on the economics of our situation, both at
the granular budgetary level (“<em>are</em> digital initative units better
funded than public service units?”) and at the level of political economy. How
we sign contracts, how we work with our vendors, how we engage with our
administrations and our parent organizations, all of this is being done
too positively, too hermetically, too naively. If we seriously want to
change our library culture in order to support library work that will
allow us to engage and work with researchers, teachers, students, we are
going to have to make some serious changes, we have to recognize our
collective power to force things to change (a lesson we need to learn on
the labour front as well), and we will likely need to get our hands
dirty. For, even if we are going through a turn towards (digital) data
as the overarching model, we need to be materialists too, and
understand, challenge, and employ the material conditions in which we
work.</p>
