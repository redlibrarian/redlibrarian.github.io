<p>When I was young, I attended a meeting of the Winnipeg IWW, in the
course of which a young bike courier asked about union certification for
his “cooperative”. An older man took issue with the young man’s
characterization of the organization as a cooperative, demanding to know
who owned the equipment, whose name was on the lease - “who signs the
paychecks?”. The lesson here was to dig below the comforting phrases and
descriptors to the economic (and therefore power) relations that
actually pertained.</p>

<p>As part of the Social Studies and Humanities Congress being held in
Calgary, my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/seanluyk">Sean Luyk</a> tweeted out the <a href="http://capalibrarians.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/StatementOnCollegialGovernance2015AGM.pdf">CAPAL “Statement on
Collegial
Governance”</a> dated April 2015 (and approved at the CAPAL AGM on
June 1). I’m somewhat interested in the question of collegial governance
because it’s something we talk a lot about but rarely, if ever, see in
action. Sean and Eva Revitt’s talk at University of Alberta earlier this
year on <a href="http://www.cjal.ca/index.php/capal/article/view/24307">their work studying library councils</a> was very
interesting, especially because it underscored the fact that whatever
committees librarians belong to within U of A, we certainly have nothing
approaching collegial governance (though we do have a library council).
So I glanced briefly at the CAPAL statement, after which the following
exchange took place:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/redlibrarian">@redlibrarian</a> I
agree with you, it&#39;s best read as an aspirational
document</p>&mdash; Sean Luyk (@SeanLuyk) <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanLuyk/status/737765630535827456">May 31,

<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Now, “aspirational” to me indicates that it describes a state of affairs
to be worked toward (to aspire to), but if this is the case, surely an
aspirational document must take care to accurately describe the
<em>current</em>
state of affairs. If it does not - if, as Sean further states, the
audience of the document is librarians in bargaining positions and
senior administration - then it may actually <em>harm</em> the librarians’
bargaining position to mischaracterize the situation, playing into the
hands of senior administration who, let’s face it, are unlikely to read
such a document, let alone take it seriously.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CAPAL/ACBAP endorses professional academic librarians as equal
participants in the governance structures of academic institutions and
recognizes the core role of academic librarians in the teaching and the
advancement of research and knowledge in the mission of educational
institutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This opening statement does not define who the participants are that we
would like librarians to be equal to. Faculty? That’s not a homogeneous
group within an institution. Administration? The University President?
The vice-presidents and associate vice-presidents? Once we begin to ask
“equal to whom”, we are forced to recognize that “equality” is not a
term that can be used to describe the hierarchy of a university. And
once “equality” is thrown in doubt, then “endorsing” a view of
librarians as “equal participants” becomes not only too vague to mean
anything, it in fact covers up the unequal, hierarchical structure of
the organization. Hiding the fact of an unequal employer – worker
relationship behind an illusion of equality is dangerous at the best of
times, but especially so in a period of collective bargaining. One of
the ways in which capitalism succeeds in continuing to exploit workers
is by mystifying its own economic relationships. In the same way that
the bike courier “cooperative” hid a reality of employment,
characterizing a university as an egalitarian, democratic organization
obscures the reality of economic domination at play within all the
constituent relationships. To paraphrase the older worker at that IWW
meeting, if librarians should participate at all levels of the
organization does this mean we can write the checks? Obviously not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frequently a minority within their academic communities, it is often
difficult for academic librarians to
achieve equal representation within a democratic process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, which “democratic process” is being described here? I’ve seen no
indication at any of the universities I’ve worked at that anything that
could remotely be described as “democracy” holds for the institution.
The members of the board of governors are political appointees, and the
search criteria, remuneration, and decision-making powers of the
president and VPs fly in the face of anything that might even be called
<em>bourgeois</em> democracy (which isn’t, in the end, democracy at all).
Universities are not democratic institutions. All of the committees and
councils that faculty (and librarians) belong to serves only to hide
that fact and to give academics a semblance of agency within the larger
organization. To insist that universities and libraries are somehow
democratic is dangerously naïve.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Centralized and unilateral decision-making risks alienation and is
counterproductive to the advancement of an organization’s mission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this makes it sound as if such a model of decision making is an
aberration, something that, once it is pointed out, everyone will agree
to remedy. It ignores the fact that centralized and unilateral
decision-making is the norm in universities and in academic libraries.
To pretend otherwise, especially to librarians in a bargaining position,
is to play into the hands of the employer’s bargaining team. Revitt and
Luyk state the case more strongly when they note “evidence of a general
disenfranchisement of librarians from significant decisions affecting
library operations, resources, services, and the appointment and
evaluation of senior library administrative positions”.This has certainly
been borne out in my experience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Academic libraries, like the institutions that house them, are public
spheres that play a critical role in safeguarding our democratic
freedoms; and as such, they must be governed based on values rooted in
the public good and professional ethics and principles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, I’m afraid, is an opinion stated as a fact, with nothing to support it. As always the truth is more
complicated than that. Leaving aside the question of what “democratic
freedoms” we in fact possess, it can also be argued that academic
libraries play a role in the management of the economy (through
controlling supply and demand of workers at different levels of
accreditation) as well as the reproduction of ideology and the cultural
hegemony of the ruling class. Now, the library is not <em>just</em> these things,
but it is <em>also</em> those things, no matter what else it is. To give a
one-sided description of <em>anything</em>, never mind academic libraries, is an
abdication of critical thinking, something that libraries are supposed
to promote. It does no-one any good to repeat over and over again a
naïve and simplistic view, an ahistorical, fairy-tale view of the
importance of libraries. By repeating phrases such as these to those who
don’t believe a word of it (employers, administrators, etc), we play
into their hands. As long as they pay lip-service to these views we can
be led into anything.</p>

<p>What follows after this is a description of what a library council
should look like. This, I suppose, is the aspirational part of the
document, and I agree that such proposals would – if they could be
effected – be helpful and beneficial to library workers in all sorts of
ways. But to base such proposals on a vague and one-sided
characterization of the university and the library as egalitarian,
democratic upholders of the public good means, on the one hand, the
proposals will never be enacted (because nothing challenges the
administrations rosy characterization of the mission and structure of
the university and library) and on the other hand that librarians will
lose out on an opportunity to cast a critical eye on the organizations
that we are extremely privileged to work in.</p>

<p>Elsewhere on this blog, I have criticized the <a href="http://redlibrarian.github.io/introduction/2016/03/04/precarity.html">bourgeois university</a>
and provided a blue-sky notion of an <a href="http://redlibrarian.github.io/introduction/2016/05/02/organisational-structure-democratic-centralism.html">alternative model of organization</a>, one that doesn’t require us to attempt to win any recognition from
our employers by repeating platitudes about democracy and
egalitarianism.</p>

<p>Now, I recognize the importance of propaganda, but for propaganda to be
effective it has to be just a little more extreme that what everyone can
agree with. It is unclear whether the CAPAL statement is intended to be
propaganda or whether it is actually meant to have be used as a tool in
collective bargaining, or even whether it is simply meant to be
educational. The problem with this statement is not just that it is
vague, not just that it argues a single rosy opinion, the problem is
that it is safe, and therefore, from an administrator’s point of view,
can be safely ignored.</p>

<p>In closing, I have to admit that the argument can be made that
university and library administrators will ignore what I write too. The
difference is that I know that nothing I say can change the fundamental
nature of my relationship to the university and library <em>as a worker</em>.
All I can do is to write for other library workers, and the greatest
courtesy I can do, in that case, is to try to speak as plainly as
possible and to expose, as consistently as I can, the reality of “who
signs the paychecks”.</p>
