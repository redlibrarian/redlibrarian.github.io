<p>On Friday, <a href="https://twitter.com/MacResColls">McMaster Rare Books</a>
rightly took issue with the erasure of archival labour coincident with
the use of a letter written by Bertrand Russel, which is in their
archives. This letter has “gone viral” several times over the last few
years, variously claiming to have been “unearthed” by a researcher - in
fact, it is located due to the work of acquiring, sorting, describing,
encoding, and digitizing performed by professional archivists. This kind
of erasure of the labour of library and archives workers both inside and
outside academia.</p>

<p>But it occurs to me that the <em>erasure</em> of labour is not the only thing
going on here. Under the current mode of capitalism, everything is a
commodity, including one’s online “brand” and “virality” itself. The
value of the commodity, as with all commodities, is commensurate with
the labour that goes into its production. The moment of erasure comes
when the research attempts to pass off the labour of archivists as their
own (using labour-intensive words like “unearth”). But the harnessing of
another’s labour power to increase the value of one’s own commodity,
while not sharing in the value of the object produced has another name:
exploitation. In addition to the erasure of archival labour, in this
case, the archivists are also being exploited. Now, working primarily
(at least in Canada) in the public sphere, making a public salary,
academic librarians and archivists tend not to worry <em>too much</em> about
this kind of exploitation in general - we’re making a public salary, and
we’re generally happy for our labour to contribute to the public good.
But brand management and virality are typically <em>not</em> part of the public
good, but private betterment, that is - profit. We tend to get pretty
riled at the idea of our publicly funded work being used to further
private interests.</p>

<p>A few years ago when the <a href="https://www.folio.org/">Future of Libraries is
Open</a> (FOLIO) project was announced, it caused a bit of
confusion in the library world. Our ILS vendor ecosystem has moved
rapidly towards cloud-based services, and Ebsco, which doesn’t have an
ILS project, seemed to be trying to move into this area. However, the
FOLIO project was positioned as arms-length from Ebsco, an independent
community-led project, built on the hoary
<a href="https://www.openlibraryenvironment.org/">Koali-OLE</a> project, begun in 2008. 
Billed as a partnership between the “FOLIO Community”, Ebsco, and
IndexData, FOLIO promises to be “a true partnership
between libraries and vendors in which we are each making real
substantive contributions based on our unique strengths.”</p>

<p>When we look at the <a href="https://www.folio.org/collaboration/">FOLIO community members
lists</a>, however, we can see that
of the 7 that are specifically mentioned, 4 are vendors and 1 is OLE,
and the other is a vague “Libraries”, whose contribution will be
“Guiding, Discussing, Developing, Collaborating”. So far, this looks
like a pretty standard “Public-Private Partnership” so fond of
neoliberal governance, in other words, a mechanisms for “privatizing
profits and socializing losses”.</p>

<p>Now, Ebsco has been making the rounds for the last few years - at the
annual Access conference, for example - to push for collaborative work
by librarians, library technologies, and library software developers to
start building ILS modules on top of the FOLIO SaaS platform. This is
described as seeking in kind collaborative contributions to an
open-source library product. Leaving aside the question of who needed
FOLIO in the first place (our ILS market is pretty much sewn up by
proprietary vendors, and we
have two mature open-source <a href="http://www.koha.org/">ILS</a>
<a href="https://evergreen-ils.org/">products</a>), this looks to me like an
attempt by a group of vendors - with Ebsco in the lead - to tap into the
large amount of open-source software development taking place in
libraries which, from a vendor perspective, <em>no-one is profiting from</em>.
From a capitalist viewpoint, this is wasted (i.e. unexploited labour).</p>

<p>For a while, I was uneasy with the FOLIO project, but couldn’t quite put
my finger on it. There was a suggestion of “open-washing” a proprietary
product, but the FOLIO SaaS platform is open-source as well. Where is
Ebsco’s (or Sirsi’s or IndexData’s) skin in this game? Well, it turns
out that the theoretical “way in” to properly thinking about this comes
in form of recent writing around “platform labour”.</p>

<p>In January, 2016, the labour theorist Ursula Huws asked whether platform
labour was <a href="http://www.progressiveeconomy.eu/content/platform-labour-sharing-economy-or-virtual-wild">“sharing economy or wild
west?”</a>,
noting that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For some idealists, [platform labour] is even seen as a way to bring about a
post-capitalist society. Others, using terms like ‘workforce on
demand’, or ‘liquid labour’ see it as a way of creating a just-in-time
workforce, sometimes described as a ‘human cloud’ or ‘crowd’, that is
available on tap for specific tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/schools/cas_sites/sociology/pdf/SocCompass%20Sharing%20Economy%20v3.pdf">Juliet Schor and William Atwood-Charles
argue</a> that platform labour
“emerged from the wreckage of the 2008 financial collapse with multiple
positive claims about its potential to change the world”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Proponents of what was originally called “collaborative
consumption” highlighted the ability of platforms and
apps like Airbnb and Uber to use
“underutilized” assets more efficiently, build social connection and
trust through person-to-person
economies, reduce environmental footprints and help ordinary people cope
with difficult economic times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, very similar arguments are used to describe the FOLIO
initiative as other labour platforms. It should come as no surprise
that the exploitation of platform labour is irremediably gendered and
racialized, as Niels van Doorn <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1369118X.2017.1294194">has pointed
out</a>,
but I think there’s an additional angle to all of this, reflecting on
neoliberalism’s contradictory attitude to the state and the public
sector.</p>

<p>According to neoliberal theory, state intervention should be minimized
to allow the unfettered, unregulated, smooth movement of capital and
commodities (except labour) wherever it can make the most profit. In
reality, however, capital accumulation is shored up by strategic state
interventions in particular areas (the “commanding heights” of the
economy, for example, or in the suppression of unions, cf. Thatcher
against the miners, or Reagan against the air-traffic controllers). One
of the areas still - for the moment - subsidized and regulated by the
state is post-secondary education, offering good salaries and benefits
(for the most part) to relatively large labour forces. For
neoliberalism, this labour is just as untapped as off-duty cab drivers
were for Uber, or vacationing apartment dwellers were for AirBnB. There
are profits to be made off this labour, and there are ways to get the
labour for free. In this case, even the maintenance of the labourer
themselves, which is ensured in the form of wages under capitalism, is
avoided by the entrepreneur. The wages - including the social wage - are
paid 100% by the state in the form of public funding for post-secondary
education.</p>

<p>But why stop at post-secondary education? Ben Tarnoff writing in the
Guardian argues that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/21/coding-education-teaching-silicon-valley-wages">“Tech’s push to teach coding isn’t about kids’
success – it’s about cutting
wages”</a>.
In addition to adding to the “industrial reserve army” keeping down the
wages of skilled workers in silicon valley, the training of these
workers can be offloaded to the state (through schools) and the work
itself can be paid for be <em>anyone else</em> in the form of platform
labour. With corporations set to reap the profits, as always.</p>

<p>I’m still not sure what Ebsco, Sirsi, or IndexData’s end-game is. I
think at the moment they may not have one - they may be content merely
to get other people’s labour working for them, just as researchers who
erase the labour of archivists mobilize archival labour for their own
private interest.</p>
