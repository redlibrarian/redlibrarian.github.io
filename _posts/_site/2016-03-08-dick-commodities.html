<p>Philip K. Dick (1928 – 1982) is mainly known for a certain kind of
high-concept, countercultural science-fiction, full of drug use,
paranoia, and metaphysical “big questions”. But what struck me in going on
a PKD jag lately was not only the focus on commodities in Dick’s
fiction, but the focus on what Marx called “the fetishism” of
commodities, the products of human labour.</p>

<p>Marx’s concept of fetishism had a long history, but his immediate
influence was Ludwig Feuerbach, who viewed religion as, in Marx’s words,
a realm in which “the products of the human brain appear as autonomous
figures endowed with a life of their own, which enter into relations
both with each other and with the human race” (<em>Capital</em>, Penguin
Classics, p. 165). Human ideas, fears, hopes, emotions, become embodied in external things, which then appear to human beings as objects separate from human beings, which
exist in the world and enter into relations with us. The process of
fetishization, then, is similar to what Lukacs and others have called
“reification”, in which a nexus of human relationships is mistaken for
an objective fact, the classic example of which is the commodity itself.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of <em>Capital</em>, in which he analyzes in great detail
the nature and characteristics of the commodity, Marx justifies this
analysis by exposing the “mystery” of the commodity, the way in which
the actual nature of commodities is hidden from the very people whose
lives are daily confronted with the world as ‘an immense collection of
commodities’ (p. 125). The section in which Marx sums up his
analysis and described commodity fetishism deserves to be quoted at
length:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mysterious character of the commodity-form consists therefore
simple in the fact that the commodity reflects the social
characteristics of men’s own labour as objective characteristics of the
products of labour themselves, as the socio-natural properties of these
things. Hence it also reflects the social relation of the producers to
the sum total of labour as a social relation between objects, a
relation which exists apart from and outside the producers. Through
this substitution, the products of labour become commodities, sensuous
things which are at the same time suprasensible or social. […] [T]he
commodity-form and the value-relation of the products of labour within
which it appears, have absolutely no connection with the physical
nature of the commodity and the material relations arising out of this.
It is nothing but the definite social relation between men themselves
which assumes here, for them, the fantastic form of a relation between
things. (p. 164-165).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are unable to see and recognize the truth about commodities by
endowing them with properties and powers apart from their nature as
products of labour, by mistaken their nature as products of our labour
for something independent of us. In reading many PKD novels in a short
period I was struck not only by how his worlds are so completely
dominated by commodities, but how the paranoia and “unreality” of Dick’s
fiction is so often expressed through an exposure or breakdown of the
fetishism of commodities, a realization of the commodity as product of
human relationships, an unmasking of the domination we human beings have
willingly placed ourselves in. The commodity is the representation of
that domination, but it hides the fact that we are dominated by
ourselves, by the very relations that the commodity mystifies.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, in <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, commodities play
a huge role in Dick’s world-building. In a San Francisco governed by the
Japanese, victorious after World War Two, American artefacts have
enormous value, and a black-market in knock-offs thrives. Dick
interrogates the nature of these commodities, asks what is <em>inside</em> the
commodity that makes it valuable (in this, mirroring Marx’s intense
interest in the nature of the commodity in <em>Capital</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Don’t you feel it?” he kidded her. “The historicity?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>She said, “What is ‘historicity’?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When a thing has history in it. Listen. One of those two Zippo lighters
was in Franklin D. Roosevelt’s pocket when he was assassinated. And one
wasn’t. One has historicity, a hell of a lot of it. As much as any
object ever had. And one has nothing. Can you feel it?” He nudged her.
“You can’t. You can’t tell which is which. There’s no ‘mystical plasmic
presence,’ no ‘aura’ around it.” (<em>The Man in the High Castle</em>, in <em>Four Novels of the 1960s</em>, Library of America, p. 57).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite their differing views of the nature of value (Dick’s
“historicity” vs. Marx’s labour theory), both Marx and Dick understand
that the value or significance of a commodity is not inherent within it,
but is imbued in it by us. It’s value is in the human relationship that
intersect with it. Commodities are dizzyingly abundant in <em>The Man in the
High Castle</em>, as in other PKD novels, whether the commodity is a
collection of miniature sets and figures (<em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer
Eldritch</em>), records and ID-cards (<em>Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said</em>), androids
(<em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</em>) or drugs (most of the novels,
including A Scanner Darkly). Commodities are mountain of physicality, an
impersonal force that weighs on all of Dick’s characters, as indeed it
weighs on all of us who live under capitalism.</p>

<p>Much could be written on the idea of “drugs as commodity” in Dick, but I
want to turn to perhaps the most sustained interrogation of commodities
and fetishism in Dick’s novels: the fabulous Ubik in the novel of the
same name.  One is initially struck by the chapter epigraphs, each one
proclaiming the virtues of the same wonderful product in the style of
advertising copy. From chapter one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Friends, this is clean-up time and we’re discounting all our silent,
electric Ubiks by this much money. Yes, we’re throwing away the
bluebook. And remember, every Ubik on our lot has been used only as
directed. (Ubik, Library of America, p. 611).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reader would be forgiven for assuming Ubik to be a kind of vehicle.
But as the chapters go on, the precise nature of Ubik becomes
increasingly less clear. From chapters two and three:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best way to ask for beer is to sing out for Ubik. Made from select
hops, choice water, slow-aged for perfect flavour, Ubik is the nation’s
number-one choice in beer. Made only in Cleveland. (p. 618).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instant Ubik has all the fresh flavour of just-brewed drip coffee. Your
husband will say, Christ, Sally, I used to think your coffee was only
so-so. But now, wow! Safe when taken as directed. (p. 625).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ubik itself does not enter the plot of the novel until chapter 10. Until
then, we are presented with something – clearly a commodity – whose
nature does not reside in what it <em>does</em>. The value of Ubik is independent
of it’s use; in Marx’s terms Ubik’s “use-value” is immaterial.  By the
time Ubik is finally presented to the reader as a plot element, the cast
of characters are in the midst of a nightmarish reality that seems to be
killing them through some kind of time-effect. Ubik comes on the scene
with a promise to reconstitute a decaying reality: “One invisible
puff-puff whisk of economically priced Ubik banished compulsive
obsessive fears that the entire world is turning into clotted milk,
worn-out tape recorders and obsolete iron-cage elevators…” Belief in
Ubik – in the form of an aerosol – literally keeps the world together.
It turns out (spoilers ahead!) that the characters are comatose, locked
into a mental network, while their bodies are kept alive following a
massive explosion. As their bodies die and their minds fade, the world
itself dissolves, and it is only Ubik that holds the final dissolution
at bay. But Ubik has no nature of its own, the aerosol form is merely
the accident of the minds locked in the network (it could, in fact, take
on any of the forms of the commodity, as evidenced by the chapter
headings). Ubik is nothing but the manifestation of a group of people’s
belief in the unity and stability of the world. In this sense, Ubik not
only provides a perfect illustration of commodity fetishism, but of the
psychological truth of historical materialism itself. It is the system
of commodity production itself that determines, creates, and preserves
our consciousness and, like Ubik, like all commodities in PKD, it is our
blindness to the truth of the mystery known as “the commodity” that
provides the limit to what can be understood as real.</p>

<p>These are just a few thoughts I had on reading PKD last summer and
autumn. I think there’s plenty of scope for digging more into the nature
of commodities in Dick’s fiction, but that’s probably enough for now.</p>
