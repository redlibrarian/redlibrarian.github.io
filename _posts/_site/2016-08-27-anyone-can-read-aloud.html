<p>In organizing my files this weekend, I came across a paper I wrote in
library school under the influence of exposure to the history of
reading. For some reason, the act of reading struck me while rereading
Greene’s <em>Heart of the Matter</em>, and I wanted to explore some of the
ramifications. The paper exposes, I think, the fact that I was by no
means conversant with all (any?) of the literature about orality and
literacy, Greene, or indeed literary studies itself. Despite that, I
think there are a few interesting ideas here, and it might be of
interest to someone.</p>
