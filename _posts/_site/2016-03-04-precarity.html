<p>Now, I realized quite quickly that these each of these phrases is
compressed enough to require unpacking unpacking on its own, so I today
I just want to tackle the idea of the university as a “job sponge”,
which is the piece I’ve been carrying around with me the longest. This
simplification of the initial idea, however, is still difficult to
figure out how to frame. Should I start with “credential creep” or
“tuition as surplus profit”, both of which are interesting aspects of
this problem. There are many different ways to come at the idea of the
university as intentionally keeping people out of the work-force.  In
the end, as always, it was best to go all the way back to Marx for a way
to think through this idea, so I have decided to focus these notes on
the idea of precarity and the reserve army of labour. Others have
written on <a href="http://bibliocracy-now.tumblr.com/post/72506786815/on-precarity">precarity</a> and <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/crowdsourcing-open-data-and-precarious-labour">exploitation</a>,
and to them I am indebted.</p>

<p>In Chapter 25 of <em>Capital</em>, Volume One, Marx talks about the “industrial
reserve army”, that is, the mass of unemployed people who are produced
by capitalism and kept in reserve to compensate for fluctuations in the
proportion of constant and variable capital in the economy (briefly,
constant capital refers to non-labour components of production, and
variable capital to labour). Marx refers to this proportion as “the
organic composition of capital” Since capitalism is always in flux,
always in a position of constantly reappearing disequilibrium, the
organic composition of capital is also always in flux; the needs of
industry for labour are always changing. In order to deal with this
changing requirement for labour efficiently, capital must always have a
supply of unemployed labour waiting to put to work, and somewhere for
the unemployed to be “parked” when the need for labour diminishes. In
the 19th century, when Marx was writing, there were ample “labour sinks”
or “employment sponges”, as anyone who has read Dickens can attest. In <em>A
Christmas Carol</em>, Scrooge lets the cat out of the bag, so to speak:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“At this festive season of the year, Mr Scrooge, … it is more than
usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the Poor
and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time. Many thousands
are in want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands are in want of
common comforts, sir.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Are there no prisons?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Plenty of prisons…”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And the Union workhouses.” demanded Scrooge. “Are they still in
operation?”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Both very busy, sir…”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Those who are badly off must go there.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Many can’t go there; and many would rather die.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If they would rather die,” said Scrooge, “they had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time that Dickens was writing, of course, universities accepted
only the sons of the bourgeoisie, i.e., those who were wealthy enough
not to have to work themselves (euphemistically called “independently
wealthy”, to hide the fact that their wealth was in fact dependent on
the exploitation of labour). The University at this time cannot be seen
as a job sponge, because those who attended University were not workers;
had they not been at University, they should have been just as idle.</p>

<p>This situation changed after the First World War, when returning
soldiers, often working class, were admitted to university. This
corresponded to a change in the position of women in the universities as
well. For example, women were allowed to attend lectures at Oxford, but
not to matriculate, since 1870. In 1920, a new University statute
granted women “full membership” of the university. These changes opened
universities up to more diverse populations than simply the sons of the
upper and middle classes, a move which has always been understood by
bourgeois ideology as a “democratization” of the university, and thus as
a social positive.</p>

<p>During and after the Second World War, and into the long boom,
productivity and thus the need for labour remained high. This is the
classic period of the university as democratic opportunity, the period
when more and more families were able to send their children (often for
the first time in history) to get an education. During this period, the
“organic composition of capital” gradually changed, and I would argue
that the increasing enrollments at universities from the 1960s to the
present are due not simply to the increased wealth and leisure of
average citizens, who can now afford both the tuition and the lack of
income provided by an unemployed student; not simply to this, but also
to the fact that production has been on the decline since at least the
early 1970s. As fewer and fewer jobs require fewer and fewer workers, as
capitalism moves production to parts of the world where labour is cheap,
and as the rise in standard of living in the West forced the closure of
such institutions as the workhouse, it fell to the universities to
become one of two primary job sinks in Western society (the other being
the system of mass incarceration in place today).</p>

<p>Which brings me to the question of precarity. Part-time work, zero-hour
contracts, short- and limited-term “fluid” labour, have all reached new
heights in the last five to ten years. The University has become a
mechanism for the efficient management of labour supply. Not only is it
able to keep more and more people out of the workforce for longer and
longer periods (which is where “credential inflation” comes in), but it
is in fact able to manage oversupply in fields where this is required by
the economic system.</p>

<p>The oversupply of librarians is discussed a lot, but I want to offer a
perspective that connects precarity oversupply to the managerial
mechanism of the university. Librarians have historically been a
privileged class of labour: we have historically had permanent
employment, good pay, good benefits. These are all things that the
current phase of capitalism needs to abolish, in a futile attempt to
increase the rate of profit (“the return on investment”) that, again in
Marxist terms, is constantly declining. Oversupply of librarians is not
an accident, but an exigency of the capitalist system as it attempts to
dismantle what little privilege and power librarians have among the
working class. The same is true of academics. And it is the university
that, while it keeps a reserve of unemployed people out of the workforce
and unemployment lines in most sectors, floods specific sectors (like
librarianship) with workers who have no choice but to accept precarious
employment in order to put pressure on employers to gradually erode the
working conditions of all librarians. This is the classic function of
the reserve army of labour as described by Marx in <em>Capital</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The overwork of the employed part of the working class swells the ranks of the reserve, whilst conversely the greater pressure that the latter by its competition exerts on the former, forces these to submit to overwork and to subjugation under the dictates of capital. The condemnation of one part of the working class to enforced idleness by the overwork of the other part, and the converse, becomes a means of enriching the individual capitalists, and accelerates at the same time the production of the industrial reserve army on a scale corresponding with the advance of social accumulation.” (Capital, vol 1, p. 658).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mechanism of managing labour supply is not explicit or forced upon
university departments or library schools. It is managed through the
economic logic of capitalism itself. In order to maintain its position
(indeed, often its existence) within the university, a department must
continue to increase enrollment, partly for the tuition, partly for the
portion of budgets disbursed by university administration and the
state, and partly, as I have suggested, due to an ideological position
that sees always-increasing enrollment as equivalent to increased
education and opportunity. Thus the cultural logic of capitalism uses
every mechanism at its service to accomplish its end, which in this case
is the efficient and effective management of labour supply under the
guise of democratization and “uplifting the whole people” (the “promise”
of the <a href="https://uofa.ualberta.ca/promise">University of Alberta</a>.</p>

<p>What about this self-understanding of universities? What of their
“vision” and “mission” statements? What about all the people who send
their children to university for an education and increased opportunity?
The first two questions can be easily dealt with. The image of the
university as an institution of financial disinterest, whose only
concern is the search for knowledge and truth, has never been true. The
truth is always dialectical, and it is a mistake to suggest that any
human institution is entirely one thing or another, and that its
position within the structure of human relationships does not change -
along with that structure - over time. As for the final question, this
simply shows that universities, like everything else, do not operated in
a vacuum, that the ideology and “cultural logic” of capitalism is
present in the totality of how we see, understand, and think about the
world and our position in it. The only way to resist the power of this
total ideology is, as per Jameson’s exhortation in <em>The Political
Unconscious</em>, to “always historicize!”</p>

<p><em>Correction</em></p>

<p>The statement about scholarships for soldiers appearing after WWI came
from a misreading (or rather a misremembering) of Robert Graves’ memoir
<em>Goodbye to All That</em>. After the war, Graves went to Oxford as what we
would now call a “mature student”. It turns out that he had simply
deferred his university career until after the war; he would likely have
attended anyway. However, he did not pay full tuition - he was a awarded
a £60 “exhibition” (a kind of scholarship) to attend. Graves writes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had just finished with Charterhouse and gone up to Harlech, when
England declared war on Germany. A day or two later I decided to
enlist. In the first place, though the papers predicted only a very
short war - over by Christmas at the outside - I hoped that it might
last long enough to delay my going to Oxford in October, which I
dreaded. (Goodbye to All That, Penguin Classics, p. 60).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The subsidizing of soldiers’ tuition can probably best be dated to the
Serviceman’s Readjustment Act - known as the GI Bill - of 1944, that is,
to end of World War 2 and the beginning of the long boom.</p>
