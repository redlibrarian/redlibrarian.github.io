<p>Richard Norman and Sean Sayers, <em>Hegel, Marx and Dialectic: A Debate</em>,
Brighton: Harvester Press, 1980.</p>

<p>First of all, I never intended to read this book. Last Thursday I was looking for a
copy of Hegel’s Shorter <em>Logic</em> in our Humanities and Social Sciences
collection, which wasn’t on the shelf, so I browsed through the other
books on Marxism and dialectics, choosing a few at random. I read a few
pages of <em>Hegel, Marx and Dialectic</em> on a break that afternoon, and
quickly became pretty engrossed in it. It was certainly one of the most
readable books on theory/philosophy I’ve ever read, and I imagine this
had something to do with the fact that both authors come out of the
Anglo-American philosophical approach, which relies more on
accessibility and plain language than its continental counterpart (and
Americans like Jameson who are heavily influenced by the continental
tradition). In any event, I found this one of the most accessible
introductions to and discussions of the dialectic I’ve ever come across.</p>

<hr />

<p>When I was doing my undergrad in the mid-1990s, when Marx and Marxism
was generally considered dead, buried, and of purely historical
interest, the idea of the dialectic would occasionally come up, often
dismissed as “simply” the idea that thesis + antithesis = synthesis. It
took me a long time to get beyond this simplistic view and start to dig
into what the dialectic really is. I have to admit that this was
provoked by being the target of that traditional Marxist accusation,
that I wasn’t being dialectical enough in something that I’d written.</p>

<p><em>Hegel, Marx and Dialectic</em> is framed as a debate between two
philosophers at the University of Kent. It is organized into five
chapters, beginning with a fairly straightforward introduction to the
Marxist dialectic, with some discussion of Hegel. Each subsequent
chapter engages with the previous one(s). What it interesting is that,
while Sayers is clearly the more orthodox Marxist, and Norman the more
solidly in the camp of formal logic, neither author dismisses the dialectic out of hand. Both understand and recognize the importance of Hegel’s logical system and of dialectics more generally. This gives the debate
more nuance and subtlety than it would have if, for example, eithe
Sayers or Norman was an out-and-out opponent of dialectical thinking.</p>

<p>The crux of the debate is the relationship of dialectics as a logical
system to the more widespread (not to say hegemonic) use of formal
logic. This debate hinges on the question of <em>contradiction</em> which, to
Hegel, Marx, and Engels, provided the motor of all change in both the
natural and human worlds (whether the natural and human worlds can be
so easily distinguished is another part of the present debate). In
formal logic, the “law of non-contradiction” states that a thing cannot
be both A and not-A at the same time. This leads adherents to formal
logic often to dismiss dialectics as irrational, since dialectics
insists on the importance and value of contradictions. Sayers and Norman
come at this problem from various angles: does “contradiction” mean
something completely different in formal logic than in dialectical
logic? If the word means the same thing, does this make the two logics
incompatible or not?</p>

<p>A lot of the debate is taken up by distinguishing dialectics, and
Hegel’s philosophy as a whole, from those “metaphysical” philosophies
that rely on formal logic, namely those philosophies that can be
described as either dualist or reductionist. For Sayers, dialectics is
positioned between the dualist and reductionist models. Dualism, in his
view, requires strict binary divisions between categories, things, and
concepts. The natural world is <em>different from</em> the human world.
Universals are <em>completely different</em> from particulars. Reductionism, on
the other hand, <em>reduces</em> one side of the division to the other: the
human world is <em>the same as</em> the natural world; universals <em>are derived
from</em> particulars. Dualism insists on difference, while reductionism
insists on identity. The dialectic, on the other hand, insists on the
“interpenetration of opposites”, that is that difference and identity
are integral parts of any category, thing, or concept. The human world
is both different from and a part of the natural world; universals can
only be universals with respect to particulars, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The discussion of the distinction between the human and natural worlds
leads to the question of whether there is a “dialectic of nature”
separate from the dialectic of concepts and ideas that are only of human
significance. Sayers takes a stronger line on this than Norman,
insisting that, for Hegel, Marx, and Engels, natural processes are
dialectical in the same way as human concepts: things in nature are
constantly changing through the presence of internal contradictions, quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes, and all this movement constitutes history. Much of this discussion hinges on the definition of materialism, and precisely <em>how</em> Marx and Engels set Hegel’s idealist dialectic on its feet. The discussion of dialectical materialism versus other kinds of “metaphysical” materialism becomes quite esoteric, but is never wilfilly obscure.</p>

<p>The presumptions of formal logic are widespread in the sciences and in
daily life (the “law of non-contradiction” seems to be intuitively
true), so much so that one might wonder whether dialectical logic still
has any bearing on the way we look at and interpret the world. It should
come as no surprise that as Marxist I think the answer is yes. An
interesting example of how simply relying on formal logic might distort
the true picture of reality and pose a potential danger is in the
question of open civic data. If we regard empirical data only formally, that is
without recognizing its context, its contradictions, and how it changes
over time, then we are not only providing an inadequate picture of the
world the data is meant to describe, but we then use the data to make
inadequate or incorrect decisions/predictions about the world. Formal
logic provides easy to analyze models of the real world, but they cannot
be the basis for policy and decision making.</p>

<p>An interesting example of how dialectical and formal logic can be seen
as antagonistic is in Zeno’s arrow paradox. For Zeno since, at any
discrete moment in time, the arrow is at rest, the arrow is at rest at
<em>every</em> discrete moment throughout its flight. The arrow is both moving
and always at rest: a paradox. For Hegel, the problem is with halting
the arrow in its flight in order to “grasp” it at every distinct moment,
much as we do when we capture a “piece” of data. It is clearly
impossible to build up motion from a collection of moments at rest.
However, if you start from the fact of motion, it is obvious that
every moment of rest is merely a convenience, a way to “grasp” the arrow
for analysis, but does not represent the truth of the arrow in motion.
From a socio-political point of view, whenever we try to “grasp” a
concept, institution, or phenomenon, we have to hold it still, violating
the fact of its motion (i.e. how it changes over time); we also have to
make it distinct (A and not not-A) by shearing it of all its
relationships. Both of these operations do violence to the complexity
and reality of the phenomenon under analysis. It is to try to resist
this violence that dialectical logic is still important.</p>

<p>To sum up, this book is
perhaps a little dated, but for me at least, it gave me a much better
sense of the scope and power of dialectical logic.</p>
