<blockquote>
  <p>To link oneself with one’s users, one must act in accordance with the
needs and wishes of one’s users. All work done for the users must start
from their needs and not from the desire of any individual, however
well-intentioned. It often happens that objectively users need a certain
change, but subjectively they are not yet conscious of the need, not yet
willing or determined to make the change. In such cases, we should wait
patiently. We should not make the change until, through our work, most
of the users have become conscious of the need and are willing and
determined to carry it out. Otherwise we shall isolate ourselves from
our users. Unless they are conscious and willing, any kind of work that
requires their participation will fail… There are two principles here:
one is the actual needs of the users rather than what we fancy they
need, and the other is the wishes of the users, who must make up their
own minds instead of our making up their minds for them.</p>

<p>This paragraph is a modified version of an extract from Mao’s address on
“The United Front in Cultural Work” from 1944 (included in the Little
Red Book, p. 125). I’ve substituted “users” for “masses” in order to see
how well Mao’s concept of the mass line fits with a contemporary
understanding of library/user relationships and user experience. This
was suggested on Twitter by @glam_librarian, and it made me start
thinking about the connections between Marxist organization and/or
movement building and how library workers understand and work with their
users. With the substitutions made above, I don’t think the paragraph
would be out of place in an article or book on library user experience
or assessment.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the Maoist mass line is meant to provide an
alternative to the “democratic centralist”, vanguard party, view of
leadership that comes out of the Leninist and Trotskyist traditions. For
Mao, “the people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the
making of world history”, and communists <em>must</em> work alongside (not
above, in front or - especially - behind) the people. Indeed, the
library (society) can only serve the needs of its users (the people) if
it is actively involved with, communicating with, and listening to, the
users. Library workers are put in the position - due to the structure of
capitalist organizations - of being separate from their users: we are
employees of a university, municipality, or other organization, and our
users are not. We are tasked with and responsible for creating library
services <em>for</em> them. In this way, the structure of the library’s
relationship with its users mirrors the undemocratic (indeed
anti-democratic) political systems of capitalism itself.</p>

<p>Elsewhere I’ve written about the idea of employing (or deploying) “dual
power” in libraries, and it seems to me that the concept of the mass
line is a useful addition to this proposal. If, as library workers, we
seriously mean to make a difference in the lives of our users, then we
can’t continue to make top down decisions around services and service
design and implementation. We have to figure out better ways of
consulting, communicating with, and listening to our users. In some
ways, the library mass line would operate similarly to the way outreach
and reference librarians in public libraries operate - being among the
library users, in a way that is foreign to many units and levels of
library leadership. Indeed, the concept of library leadership itself
comes under increasing attack if we accept the idea of dual power + mass
line.</p>

<p>One criticism of this view might be that Mao’s language still seems to
set up a separation between library workers and users that will lead to
failure. As Erin Leach wrote in a <a href="https://unifiedlibraryscene.blogspot.ca/2017/01/youve-seen-it-all.html">valuable recent blog
post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>True engagement with user communities is hard. But creating structures,
systems, and services intended for their use without their input is a
waste of everyone’s time and resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think one useful corrective to this problem might be to bear
in mind Gramsci’s distinction between traditional and organic
intellectuals (indeed, it is useful to read Mao “through” Gramsci in
this way in general). Historically, librarians have always belonged to the
class of traditional intellectuals, intellectuals that the ruling class
finds <em>already</em> on the scene, ready to help justify and support the
cultural and ideological needs of the ruling class itself (i.e. its
hegemony over the subaltern classes). What Mao is calling for, I think,
is that those of us who do mass line work - who work with users - must begin to see ourselves as
organic intellectuals, intellectuals whose responsibility is to the public - especially its most marginalized members - rather than to the ruling class.</p>

<p>“True engagement with user communities”, to my mind, means precisely
this recognition of the class nature of the work that we do and the
commitment to the needs and requirements of our users rather than to the
hegemonic requirements of the ruling class and its ideology. This
requires, in many ways, the political education of library workers,
which is a topic for another time; but it also raises a question I have
tried to address previously on this blog: the question of in what sense
the wants and needs of user groups themselves are products of and
support the ideological reproduction of capitalism.</p>

<p>Library user experience discourse tends to regard user needs as
spontaneous and essential, rather than constructed. This goes against
the Marxist view of culture as reflecting (in some sense) the forces and
relations of production present in a society at a given moment. If user
needs <em>are</em> spontaneous and not constructed, then it makes sense that
library user experience work need only hear, understand, and support the
needs of the users as expressed by those users. But if, on the other
hand, user needs are constructed and serve to support the ideological
and hegemonic requirements of the ruling class, then library user
experience work (indeed all library work) becomes much more complicated.</p>

<p>Mao doesn’t explicitly talk about ideology with respect to the mass line
(again, in this case Gramsci is a better model to follow), but he does
address the problem I have identified above. In his view, those of us
working to support the needs of users must engage in education and
social justice work in order to support real user requirements, rather
than simply the needs of the ruling class. Again, this makes the task
sound simpler and easier than it is. This is in fact extremely complex
work, with many pitfalls (most of which involve thinking of library work
with its attendant expertise as somehow privileging us with respect to
the knowledge and desires of our users). Again, I think a corrective to
this to recognize the class positions of all involved.</p>

<p>This blog post raises more questions than it answers, but I think it
points the way to potentially fruitful new directions in library/user
relationship research, while also raising problematic ideas in the area
of library management and leadership, and the concept of bourgeois
hegemony itself. I will stop here, then, with a final “adjusted” quote from Mao:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We should go to the users and learn from them, synthesize their
experience into better, articulated principles and methods, then do
[education] among the users, and call upon them to put these principles
and methods into practice so as to solve their problems and help them
achieve liberation and happiness. (LRB, p. 129).</p>
