<p>On May 5 and 6 of this year, I attended a conference on “Precarious
Academic Labour in the Age of Neoliberalism” at Okanagan College in
Kelowna, BC. I had initially put in a proposal to talk about precarity
and academic librarianship with a fairly broad view of what precarity
entails. It turned out that the focus on the conference was contract
academic staff/sessional instructors (the terminology varies). I was
initially a
little surprised, given that “neoliberalism” was in the title, at the
level of political sophistication among the attendees and presenters; it
seemed that few, if any, had a clear understanding of the
characteristics, history, and causes of neoliberalism, even
individually, never mind a shared understanding with anyone else. Part
of the problem, I think, is the notion of “good capitalism”, generally
equated with the long boom/<em>trente glorieuses</em> of the post-war consensus
and the welfare state. Neoliberalism is seen as an aberration, a (very
new) retreat from what capitalism is supposed to be. At first, I was a
little concerned that my paper might be too political; then I thought
that perhaps it was good that an explicitly Marxist perspective be
brought to the conference. In the end, my paper went over well, and I
think provided a complementary, not antagonistic or competing, viewpoint
to the other presentations.</p>

<p>However, I realized something else. This was perhaps the first time that
these people (mainly from BC and Alberta) had managed to get together, to self-organize, and to at
least begin the process of self-identification, which is a first step
towards a) being able to struggle for their own needs and b) achieving
solidarity with other groups who might identify differently, but who are
after the same thing. Due to the lack of funding and support, there are
very few opportunities for contract faculty to meet and
formulate/discuss issues important to them. So, even though I felt that
the group as a whole was a little naive (“aren’t universities supposed
to be meritocratic institutions of enlightenment!?”) and unaware (or
resistant to the idea of) their own privilege, I thought this was a
valuable and beneficial event. I was very happy to be part of it, not
only to talk about library labour issues, but to represented
librarianship in another sector of academia. Part of the issue around
all of these things is the isolation of various constituencies from each
other, especially between the permanent, tenured faculty and the rest of
us (who said class - or the labour aristocracy - was dead?).</p>
