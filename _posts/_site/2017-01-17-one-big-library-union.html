<p>Although I was never a member of the Canadian Library Association, I -
along with many other people - had some criticisms of it. One my my main
concerns was that while it <a href="http://cla.ca/wp-content/uploads/CLA_Intellectual_Freedom_Position_Stmt_27sept2015_ltrhd.pdf">officially
endorsed</a>
intellectual freedom, its endorsement had - at least as far as I could
see - no effect on the organizations that composed it. CAUT is active
in the academic world making sure that universities kept up their ends
of various bargains, and had a power to sanction that CLA never had, and
likely never wanted. In the end CLA came to represent the library
leadership class and the libraries that made it look good and supported
it financially. It was, as was pointed out a few years ago, the Canadian
<em>Library</em> Association, not the Canadian <em>Librarian</em> Association. It
wasn’t there for us.</p>

<p>One of the strange things about simply being born is that we are born
into a world that already exists. It is tempting to imagine that things
have always been as they are, or that the reason something is a certain
way is because of some objective reason. But the study of history tells
us that this is rarely, if ever, the case. Things come to be out of
struggle and argument and discourse, out of the passions, opinions,
justifications, and reasoning of the people who happen to be around and
involved. These people both self-select (people with interest and
access) and are selected or deselected (I’m thinking here mostly of
people who are <em>excluded</em> and <em>prevented</em> from participating). What this
should say to us, though, is that nothing that exists today is sacred.
We can change it all.</p>

<p>In reading about this history, I came across an episode in the library
history of Nova Scotia, around the time that CLA and Canadian
librarianship were being formalized. Much of the struggle in those days
was around forming a “community of interest” recognizable to the labour
board (the same issue still pertains to non-unionized library workers
today). In the end, the system we have now came into being: municipal
unions for public librarians, academic associations (whether unions or
not) for academic librarians, as well as some outliers. Typically,
public librarians are included in a municipal union alongside other city
workers, while academic librarians are sometimes lumped in with faculty,
sometimes not. Now, it might be politic to argue a community of interest
between academic librarians and faculty members, but it’s a stretch to
argue community of interest between public librarians and other city
workers. (And we know from experience how fragile the collegiality
between faculty and librarians can be). In addition, library workers who are not recognized as
librarians are typically in other unions, lumped in with other sectors.
The “community of interest” that applied - one assume - among library
workers as a whole is splintered among various unions and associations
(or are completely unprotected) and placed among other constituencies
with other interests. I haven’t mentioned the CLA in this framework
because to my mind the CLA didn’t really fit in here at all.</p>

<p>As this model was coming into being, alternatives were proposed in
various places. In 1973, a debate over the proper form of organization,
especially as it pertained to the guarantee of academic or faculty
status and tenure, took place in Nova Scotia, where various models of organization were proposed. One of the most interesting, to my mind, is the proposal of a province-wide union of librarians. Ruth Hafner, St Mary’s
University’s chief librarian at the time, argued that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>librarians would be better served by forming a provincial union
inclusive of all librarians with a form of librarian status akin to
academic status but focused on conditions of work and promotion specific
to the profession.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jacobs, Leona. “Academic Status for Canadian Academic Librarians: A
Brief History”, in <em>In Solidarity: Academic Librarian Labour Activism
and Union Participation in Canada</em>, edited by Jennifer Dekker and Mary
Kandiuk, Library Juice Press, 2015, p. 27.</p>

<p>This proposal was in contrast to the idea that academic librarians
should form a community of interest within the academic community
(rather than the librarianship) community, in which case wages,
evaluation/assessment, and promotion would fall under academic norms and
procedures - essentially, the system we have today. (Well, sort of -
it’s become clear to me how vastly different every university is in
terms of the policies and procedures governing their librarians).</p>

<p>What a fascinating idea. What if, instead of the current splintering of
the community of interests, we formed instead a nationwide union of
library workers, one which was able to take over and decide for itself
how library workers ought to be governed, one which had the teeth to
sanction any interference in the intellectual freedom of library
workers, one which could call a nationwide strike, rather than the
isolated labour actions library workers currently have to fight?</p>

<p>Now that the CLA is no more and has been replaced by the Canadian
Federation of Library Associations, the ambiguity of the CLA’s position
has been removed: the Federation is made up of associations, not
librarians. This leaves the ground free for a different organization -
one with some teeth - that represent the interests of library workers.
(And let me be clear, this would not be a “librarian” union, this would
be a union for all library workers).</p>

<p>This idea initially occurred to me in the context of intellectual
freedom, and the situation in which public librarians find themselves
unable to discuss issues of importance to them, or issues that the whole
field is discussing, because they don’t possess “academic freedom” (this
applies too, of course, to library technicians and other
“non-professional” library workers). A nationwide library union could
enforce an intellectual freedom clause in all library contracts in the
same way that a faculty association (and e.g. CAUT) can ensure academic
freedom in cases where it has been abrogated.</p>

<p>I have no idea what this One Big Union might look like, but the
Industrial Workers of the World might be a good model to investigate. I
also don’t know what would be required in order to implement it. But I
do know, from reading library history, that these things - as
contentious as they may be - can be implemented, can be modified after
they are implemented, but the first step is to start the conversation.</p>

<p>I’m also aware that there will be flaws, constraints, and objections to
this idea. But it’s worth raising, I think, for all that.</p>
