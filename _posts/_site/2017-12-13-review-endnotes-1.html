<p>Endnotes, <em>Endnotes 1: Preliminary Materials for a Balance Sheet of the Twentieth
Century</em> (Endnotes, October 2008).</p>

<p>According to their <a href="https://endnotes.org.uk/about">website</a>, Endnotes is
a discussion group based in Germany, the UK, and the US “primarily
oriented towards conceptualising the conditions of possibility of a
communist overcoming of the capitalist mode of producction… starting
from present conditions”. They situate themselves within the current of
“communisation theory”, which came out of the ultra-left currents after
1968. Since 2008, Endnotes has published four “issues” (really
      monographs) of their journal.</p>

<p>Left-communism has, at least since Lenin’s <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/"><em>Left-Wing Communism, an
Infantile
Disorder</em></a>
tended to be overshadowed either by authoritarian forms of Marxism (e.g.
Marxism-Leninism, Maoism) or by those forms of Marxism interested more
in cultural studies (e.g. the Frankfurt School or the New Left). Still,
there has always been a strong current of theoretical work on the more
“anarchist” side of Marxist/communist theory, including the work of
Tiqqun, The Invisible Committee, and some strains of
workerism/autonomism. The approaches of these groups can tend towards
the kind of movemenism Moufawad-Paul critiques in <em>The Communist
Necessity</em>, but I think that there’s plenty to engage with here.</p>

<p><em>Endnotes 1</em> isn’t really written by the Endnotes collective, as issues
2 - 4 are. Other than a brief introduction and conclusion, the text is
composed of articles in a debate between Gilles Dauvé and the
group Théorie Communiste, which took place between 1998 and
approximately 2008, over the categorization of and reasons for “failed”
revolutions (1921 in Russia, 1923 in Germany, 1936 in Spain, and 1968 in
France and Italy). For Dauvé, these revolutions failed because they
did not go far enough - enough of the capitalist relations remained for
the counter-revolution to take hold. In the long essay which opens the
volume, “When Insurrections Die”, Dauvé analyzes these
revolutionary moments and explains how, in his view, the opportunity for
a successful revolution was lost in each case.</p>

<p>Théorie Communiste takes issue with Dauvé in three main
areas. In the first place, they argue that he posits an essential nature of the proletariat,
of communism, and of the revolution against which each concrete instance
can be measured (and found wanting). This is a trans- or a- historical
view of these categories that TC rejects: each revolution is what it is
at its particular moment in history, and nothing else. Secondly, TC
argues that, since 1968, changes in the relations of production (i.e.
from Fordism to the mass-worker), produced changes in proletarian
consciousness, and therefore of the nature of the revolution itself.
This is marked particularly by the transition from seizing the means of
production, to “the refusal of work” on the part of workers in revolt.
TC argues that this period also marks a change in the conception of
proletarian revolution, moving from a “programmatism” (e.g. the Gotha
Programme, or the Erfurt Programme) towards a conception of revolution
less focused on the factory and the industrial worker, and more on the
social-factory, and proletarian society more broadly.</p>

<p>Thirdly, and I think most intriguingly, TC identifies the foothold of
the counter-revolution in the persistence of the commodity form itself.
As long as the commodity (the product produced for sale) remains, its
dual nature (use-value and exchange-value) will engender the persistence
of <em>all</em> of the capitalist relations of production. It is the
reproduction of the proletariat as proletariat, that is <em>as</em> a class
within capitalism, that communisation seeks to abolish. Whereas the
seizure of the means of production sees the <em>victory</em> of the proletariat
over other classes - and for Maoists, it is important to recognize the
continuation of class-struggle under socialism or the dictatorship of
the proletariat - communisation means the abolition of the proletariat
as a class (since the proletariat can only be defined as a relationship
within capitalism). This is reminiscent in some ways of the distinction
drawn by Lenin in <em>State and Revolution</em> between the socialist State,
seized in order to wither away, and the immediate smashing of the State
as a necessary element of the communist revolution.</p>

<p>Communism, then, for communisation theorists, is not a posited future
state, but a process to be adopted <em>now</em>. It is this that brings them
closest, I think, to the anarchists, and which can lead to movementism
rather than revolutionary struggle. But the idea that the seeds of the
counter-revolution are necessarily present in the structure of the
commodity is, I think, an important one.</p>

<p>I read this in a white heat. I’ve always felt suspicious of
authoritarian Marxism, though I have to admit that I don’t think there’s
necessarily a non-authoritarian alternative. Rationally, I have to come
down on the side of the Leninists or the Maoists, but temperamentally I
am closer, I think, to the anarcho-communism of Endnotes. For me, the
revolution cannot simply be the dictatorship of the proletariat - all
the capitalist relations intact but with the workers as the ruling class; it must be the complete and fundamental
transformation of society down to its most fundamental element, the
commodity itself. Only by abolishing all capitalist relations up to and including the
commodity-form can we hope to eradicate the counter-revolution and the
resurgence of capitalism. Capitalism is good at co-opting radical
movements, and being aware of the tools it uses to that end is an
important theoretical contribution. This issue of <em>Endnotes</em> sets the
stage for the elaboration of Endnotes’ own position in <em>Endnotes 2</em>.</p>
