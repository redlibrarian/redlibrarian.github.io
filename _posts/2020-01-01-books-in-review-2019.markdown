This was the year I started focused work on my PhD, so almost all of the
books I finished were fiction (as opposed to last year which had a good
balance between fiction and non-fiction), and often not particularly challenging,
something to get my mind off my work. I read a lot of political theory,
much of which I didn't read all the way through, and I also started and
left unfinished a lot of novels that therefore didn't make this list. I
read quite a few more books (36) this year than in 2017 (27) and 2018 (204), but as I
say they were often pretty straightforward books and many of them were
short.

Todd Babiak, *The Garneau Block*

Sergey and Marina Dyachenko, *Vita Nostra*

Ann Leckie, *Ancillary Justice*, *Ancillary Sword*, *Ancillary mercy*

E.L. Konigsberg, *From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs Basil E. Frankweiler*

I read a lot of Konigsberg as a kid, but this was the first - read to us
as a class in Grade 3, by my teacher (and future Winnipeg Public Library
boss), Edith Boulay.

Judy Blume, *Starring Sally J. Freedman as Herself*

For my money, Blume's best book. I reread this in one sitting.

Susan Cooper, *Over Sea, Under Stone*

Vasily Grossman, *Everything Flows*

Ivan Turgenev, *Fathers and Sons*

Vladimir Sorokin, *Day of the Oprichnik*

Ursula K. LeGuin, *A Wizard of Earthsea*

Benedict de Spiniza, *Ethics*

Vladimir Sorokin, *Bro*, *Ice*, *23,000* (the Ice Trilogy)

Fyodor Dostoyevsky, *The Gambler*

Fyodor Dostoyevsky, *Netochka Nezvanova*

Cormac McCarthy, *All the Pretty Horses*

Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, *Multitude*

Mark Haddon, *The Porpoise*

J.G. Ballard, *Crash*

Art Spiegelman, *Maus 1 & 2*

Herman Melville, *Billy Budd*

Will Eisner, *Last Day in Vietnam*

Art Spiegelman, *In the Shadow of No Towers*

Vladimir Nabokov, *Pnin*

Vladimir Nabokov, *Pale Fire*

I've always found Nabokov cold and hard to enjoy - to fond of his own
verbal and intellectual tricks. Pnin was quite good, though, and I've
always felt Pale Fire was his best work. As with the first time I read
it the Ruritanian aspects of Pale Fire tend to drag, but the poem is
great, and the overall construction is amazing.

Klyuchevsky, *History of Russia, Volume 1*. 

Volume 1 of Klyuchevsky's five-volume *Kurs russkogo istoriia*. I read some Klyuchevsky in my undergrad and I really like the way he
approaches Russian history - these are not textbooks, but explanatory
narratives.

Graham Greene, *England Made Me*

Graham Greene, *A Gun For Sale*

Graham Greene, *Brighton Rock*

Graham Greene, *The End of the Affair*

Graham Greene, *The Ministry of Fear*

With the exception of *The Ministry of Fear*, these were all rereads.
What can I say, absolutely my favourite novelist. I've been reading
Greene since 1992, the year after he died, and I will likely go on
periodic binges like this for the rest of my life.

Lev Tolstoy, *My Confession, and, The Spirit of Christ's Teaching*.

I prefer Dostoyevsky's novels to Tolstoy's, and Tolstoy's religious
moralizing always bothered me. But I picked up a nice old hardcover
edition of this book at random in a used bookstore and I really enjoyed
it. His account of how he came to religion after a life of meaningless
religiosity is a good account of the nihilism that we all have to face
up to, and his anti-clerical interpretation of the gospels is very close
to my own. I may end up reading more of Tolstoy's religious and
anarchist work in the coming year, we'll see.
