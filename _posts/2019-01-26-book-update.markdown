Just a quick update on the status of the book I'm currently writing on
the democratic discourse of librarianship. The book now has a [publisher
page](http://litwinbooks.com/books/confronting-the-democratic-discourse-of-librarianship/)
and an expected publication date of May 2019.

Next week I'm presenting the basic argument of the book at the Ontario
Library Association Superconference in a session called "Libraries and
Democracy: A Critique".
